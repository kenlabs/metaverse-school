# 4 meanings of the Metaverse

Starting from the original meaning of "Meta (Meta) + Verse (Universe)", Deloitte has defined and imagined the future of the Metaverse as "a converged world of the virtual and the real". This has four meanings: a virtual mirror world that simulates the real world, an innovative virtual world set apart from the real world, the real world as a facet of the Metaverse, and the convergence of the virtual and real worlds beyond either the virtual or the real world.

The Metaverse will include almost all elements of our real world. This is the key to understanding the longterm state of the Metaverse and how fundamentally and profoundly it will influence us. The four meanings above can described as follows: 

### Meaning 1: A virtual mirror world that simulates reality 

The Metaverse includes a virtual world that simulates almost every element of the real world, including individual identity, enterprise identity, the business world, entertainment, social interaction, civilization, legal, tax, and governance structures, and one of the most critical features of our real world—feelings. 

This is an important starting point for understanding and envisioning the future direction of the Metaverse. The public's current perception of the Metaverse encompasses games, experiences, technologies, and social applications. These are parts of the Metaverse, but the future of the Metaverse is much more than the sum of those parts. 

The term Metaverse originated from a scene in Snow Crash. It is a conceptual extension of that scene to imagine a "real" virtual world that is a full simulation and complete mirror of the real world. 

Neil Stephenson's Snow Crash describes such a virtual world: the protagonist enters a commercial block, on the Champs-Élysées in the super-meta-domain (the Metaverse). The street is very long, traversing 65,536 kilometers. A vast number of people pass through the commercial block, where there are many shops. Opening a shop there requires third-party approval, buying land, obtaining the relevant licenses, and bribing Inspectors. Humans walk and interact with the neighborhood as digital avatars; populating a world the author calls the Metaverse. The picture below is a schematic diagram of the scene depicted in Snow Crash. There are many core elements of the real world in its described virtual world, including neighborhoods, social interaction, commercial real estate development, business activities, and even corruption.

Derived from its depiction in Snow Crash, the future Metaverse will include a virtual world that simulates all realworld elements. There are 10 elements in the real world: environment, people, objects, institutions, society, and economic, enterprise production, individual production, civilization, and governance systems. There are also 10 elements in the virtual world corresponding to these 10 real world elements.

### Meaning 2: A native virtual world 

The Metaverse includes another virtual world. This is an innovative, native virtual world that has all the elements of the real world, but whose elements have no corresponding elements in the real world. People can use their imaginations and creativity to create completely virtual people, objects, and environments. New entities, new regulations, and new wisdom will embody innovation in this virtual native world. 

This new entity is home to people, objects, and environments shaped entirely in the virtual world, with no real world counterparts. In this Metaverse, there will be new "people" who are not avatars, but people created and who only exist in the virtual world, like virtual digital employee Cui Xiaopan, who won the 2021 Best Newcomer Award at Vanke Headquarters. Other examples include non-fungible token (NFT) objects such as pictures, audio, videos, artwork, and buildings. In this native virtual world, liberating some of the physical and spatial stipulations of the real world create a virtual natural environment.

Regulation has three aspects in this new native virtual world: governance by decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), which is completely different to the centralized model in the real world; user-created content (UGC) rather than the platform-generated content (PGC), which will completely liberate people to be creators and allow anything to be created; and the movement of people in the virtual world, unencumbered by real-world physical or spatial rules. 

New wisdom refers to artificial intelligence (AI). Virtual people, despite existing only in the Metaverse, will have the same or greater wisdom than human beings do in the real world. Currently, most AI seeks to simulate human beings by listening, speaking, reading, writing, smelling, touching, moving, and thinking. One day the wisdom of AI will go beyond human beings, and that day is not that far away given the acceleration of technology, with the computing power of Nvidia's CPUs now said to be 1 million times faster than it was 10 years ago. 

Current Metaverse platforms have already partially achieved the abovementioned three innovations in the native virtual world. When the virtual world frees us from the limitations of physical space, human beings can bring their thinking and creativity into full play, creating the potential for limitless innovation.

### Meaning 3: The real world 

The real world is an integral part of Metaverse. All elements in the virtual mirror world are facsimiles of elements in the real world. The value of the virtual world is generated by interactions between it and the real world.

### Meaning 4: Convergence and interaction of the virtual and real worlds 

In the end, the virtual world and the real world will form a closely converged and interacting world— from the virtual to the real, the real to the virtual, the virtual in the real, and the real in the virtual—like a "live action" version of the coexistence of robots in the real and virtual worlds seen in Terminator . This convergence and interaction mean the Metaverse will transcend both and each of the real and virtual worlds, calling back to the original meaning of the word "Meta" as above or beyond. The degree to which the virtual world is converging and interacting with the real world is a critical criterion in evaluating the value of the Metaverse. Among various definitions of the Metaverse, one posits that it will only be when people rely on the virtual world more than they rely on the real world that the Metaverse will be fully formed.
