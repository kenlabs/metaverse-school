# Introduction

In this nascent phase of the Metaverse, the industry has not formed a unified standard for defining or understanding it. It is a garden in which 100 flowers are blooming and 100 schools of thought contend. 

David Bashuki, CEO of Roblox, has proposed eight elements of the Metaverse: identity, sociality, immersion, low latency, diversity, anywhere, economic system, and civilization. Renowned analyst Matthew Ball has identified six characteristics of the Metaverse: sustainability, real-time, no access restrictions, economic functions, connectivity, and creativity. Jon Radoff, founder of Beamable, has ideated seven levels of Metaverse construction: experience, discovery, creator economy, spatial computing, decentralization, human-computer interaction, and infrastructure. In China, some institutions have proposed that the Metaverse is a new internet application and social arena that integrates various new technologies, shaping a virtual space in an online world that mirrors the natural world in an increasingly realistic digital landscape. 

These different understandings and definitions of the Metaverse come from different perspectives, including experiential, technological, or regulatory interpretations. It is not easy to provide a concise, definitive, unified definition that covers all these dimensions. 

## What is the metaverse? 

### Metaverse in popular culture

In Stephenson's dystopian view of the future, *Snow Crash*, people gained status based on the technical skill of their avatars. Another indication of status was the ability to access certain restricted environments -- a precursor to the paywalls and registration requirements some websites use today.

*Ready Player One* by Ernest Cline, later made into a movie by Steven Spielberg, was another novel that helped popularize the idea of the metaverse. The 2011 dystopian sci-fi novel is set in the year 2045, where people escape the problems plaguing Earth in a virtual world called The Oasis. Users access the world using a virtual reality visor and haptic gloves that let them grab and touch objects in the digital environment.

### Matthew Ball 

In his best-selling [primer](https://www.matthewball.vc/metaversebook), *The Metaverse: And How It Will Revolutionize Everything*, author Matthew Ball defined the metaverse as the following:

> A massively scaled and interoperable network of real-time rendered 3D virtual worlds that can be experienced synchronously and persistently by an effectively unlimited number of users with an individual sense of presence and with continuity of data, such as identity, history, entitlements, objects, communications and payments. 

### Outlier Ventures

Technically the original vision and definition of The Metaverse was a point in time when the blurring of a distinction between physical and digital happens. This has typically been thought of in the context of AR (Augmented Reality) and VR (Virtual Reality) otherwise known as Mixed Reality becoming ubiquitous.

However, we believe it’s important we think of it not as a destination but a journey or process.

This is because it’s important to acknowledge the beginnings of the Metaverse are already here and if we think of it as a far off destination we will sleep walk into not addressing some fundamental design choices and potentially replicate or deepen what is broken about the Web today.

It seems one of the defining characteristics of a metaverse was that somehow it was an economic system independent of, and enjoys supremacy to, old fiat based economies controlled by nation states.

If we look at Facebook’s efforts to launch its own digital currency with Libra (which would have extended to Oculus), because it is a highly centralised and fiat based company, it has been aggressively constrained and in effect neutered as a genuine disruptive and sovereign crypto-currency.

It could be considered partially true some games platforms are so big they are closed micro-economies, with their own currencies which they control centrally and value systems, like experience points systems, in-game items (skins) and marketplaces, where significant amounts of the wealth are held and traded.

But the reality is only a few even let you transact in and out of their closed platform using fiat but even more importantly, wealth is not directly transferable between these microeconomics into a virtual meta economy with its own sovereign currencies.

What’s more you can’t generally borrow against virtual wealth to buy physical assets, putting digital natives at an economic disadvantage, where 63% of gamers said they would actually spend more on skins if they had real world value.

We propose ultimately we believe the defining characteristic of a true Metaverse is that it needs its own economy and currencies native to it, where value can be earnt, spent, lent, borrowed or invested interchangeably in both a physical or virtual sense and most importantly without the need for a government.

### McKinsey

The metaverse means different things to different people. Some believe it’s a digital playground for friends. Others think it has the potential to be a commercial space for companies and customers.

We believe both interpretations are correct. In June 2022, McKinsey released *[Value creation in the metaverse](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/business functions/marketing and sales/our insights/value creation in the metaverse/value-creation-in-the-metaverse.pdf)*, a new report based on surveys of more than 3,400 consumers and executives, as well as interviews with 13 senior leaders and metaverse experts. Based on this analysis, we believe the metaverse is best characterized as an [evolution of today’s internet](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/marketing-in-the-metaverse-an-opportunity-for-innovation-and-experimentation)—something we are deeply immersed in, rather than something we primarily look at. It represents a convergence of digital technology to combine and extend the reach and use of cryptocurrency, artificial intelligence (AI), [augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), spatial computing, and more](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/augmented-and-virtual-reality-the-promise-and-peril-of-immersive-technologies). And the “enterprise metaverse” may coalesce in a way that unlocks even more opportunity, beyond simply serving as a virtual place where people interact.

### World Economic Forum

The metaverse is a future persistent and interconnected virtual environment where social and economic elements mirror reality. Users can interact with it and each other simultaneously across devices and immersive technologies while engaging with digital assets and property.

## Metaverse vs. multiverse vs. omniverse: Key differences

Are you aware of how technology is evolving around us? The metaverse is no longer a buzzword, and the omniverse and multiverse have entered the fray. Learn their differences here.

### Metaverse vs  Internet

The metaverse was first coined by Neal Stephenson in a science fiction novel that details the concept of a shared, virtual space where people can interact with each other and with digital representations of themselves (avatars). In many ways, the metaverse is similar to the Internet today.

However, to understand the **[metaverse](https://phemex.com/academy/what-is-the-metaverse-crypto)**, one must know it’s different from the Internet in that it isn’t limited to a device or screen, and will instead be incorporated into the world around us in immersive ways.

The internet is a network of billions of computers, millions of servers and other electronic devices. Once online, internet users can communicate with each other, view and interact with websites, and buy and sell goods and services.

The metaverse doesn't compete with the internet -- it builds on it. The internet is something that people "browse," but people can "live" in the metaverse to a degree. The growth of the internet has spawned many services that are leading the way to the creation of the metaverse.

The metaverse is a vision of what many in the computer industry believe is the next iteration of the internet: a single, shared, immersive, persistent, 3D virtual space where humans experience life in ways they could not in the physical world.

### Metaverse vs Virtual Reality
There have been heavy comparisons between the metaverse and VR, but while the metaverse is a digital space, VR is a simulated reality. In other words, VR creates an artificial environment that mimics the real world, while the metaverse is its own independent space separate from the physical world.

### Metaverse vs Augmented Reality
AR is an enhanced version of the physical world. It adds digital information on top of the real world. For example, a user can use AR to see directions superimposed on the street in front of them. The metaverse, on the other hand, is a completely separate digital space.

### Metaverse vs Multiverse
The multiverse is a collection of multiple universes – each with its own set of laws and rules. To put this into context, this would be akin to an individual’s activity on social media taking place in one universe while their activity on a gaming platform takes place in another.

The key element at play here is that universes within the multiverse aren’t necessarily connected to each other. There are limited options for transferring data or information between universes, with each one existing independent of the others.

Where the metaverse promotes a unified and interconnected approach, the multiverse champions a privacy-focused, secure, yet fragmented experience. Web2 is quite similar to a multiverse system, with many siloed platforms that are disconnected from each other.

### Metaverse vs Omniverse

#### What Is The Omniverse?
The omniverse is the sum of all universes — both real and imagined. This includes everything from the universe to parallel universes and fictional universes. Essentially, it’s the ultimate reality.

#### What Are The Differences?
* Infinite vs. Finite
  The main difference between all these terms is that the omniverse is infinite, whereas the metaverse and multiverse are finite. The omniverse also contains an infinite number of universes, while the metaverse and multiverse each contain a finite number.

* Concepts
  Another key difference is that the metaverse and multiverse are both man-made concepts, whereas the omniverse is a natural concept. The metaverse and multiverse are created by people through their actions and interactions in digital space. The omniverse, on the other hand, has always existed — it’s the sum total of all reality.
  The metaverse and multiverse can be viewed as two sides of the same coin i.e., different ways of looking at the same thing. The metaverse is a unified, interconnected space, while the multiverse is a collection of disparate universes. The omniverse, on the other hand, is the sum of all realities – both within the metaverse and the multiverse.

####  What Are The Similarities?
* Every interaction leaves a digital trace
  The three concepts all technically include virtual realities created by people through their interactions in digital space. This means that every interaction performed in the metaverse, multiverse, or omniverse leaves a digital trace.

* An endless array of possibilities
  Another similarity is that all three concepts are open-ended and ever-expanding. As concepts, the metaverse, multiverse, and omniverse are all constantly growing and evolving. Additionally, all three concepts contain an infinite number of possibilities. The metaverse, multiverse, and omniverse each offer an endless array of possibilities for exploration and discovery.
* User identity
  Lastly, all three concepts are connected with user identity. This means that one’s activity in one universe will be linked with one’s activity in another. For example, if an individual plays a game on one platform, their avatar will be the same as the one they use on another platform. Similarly, if someone makes a purchase on one website, their digital user identity will be linked with that purchase in one way or another.
* Creating a Virtual World and Boosting Creativity
  All universes are helping to build the virtual world and are shaping the internet's future. Metaverse, Omniverse, and multiverse are infinite spaces. In these virtual environments, you can make anything. Things that are difficult to build in this world can be built in virtual worlds.

## Open Metaverse vs. Closed Metaverse

In many ways, the metaverse is just another name for evolving the internet: to be more social, immersive, and far more economically sophisticated than what exists today. There are, broadly speaking, two competing visions for how to bring this about: One is decentralized, generous with property rights and new frontiers, interoperable, open, and owned by the communities that build and maintain it. The other vision — too familiar to many people today — is centralized, closed, subject to the whims of corporations; and often extracts painful economic rents from its creators, contributors, and inhabitants.

The key dimension to compare these two visions is open vs closed, and the differences between them can be conceptualized as follows:

![img](https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Metaverse-framework-In-line.jpeg)

An open metaverse is decentralized, allows users to control identity, enforces property rights, aligns incentives, and ensures value accrues to users (not platforms). An open metaverse is also transparent, permissionless, interoperable, and composable (others can freely build within and across metaverses), among other criteria.  Achieving a “true” metaverse — one that’s open versus closed — requires seven essential ingredients intrinsic to this sought-after state. The researchers of a16z argue that these are necessary to meet the minimum requirement to be called a metaverse. The goal is to clear the fog of misinformation about what is and isn’t a true metaverse for builders and would-be participants, and to provide a framework for evaluating early metaverse attempts.

### 1. Decentralization

[Decentralization](https://future.com/web3-decentralization-models-framework-principles-how-to/) is the overarching, governing principle of a proper metaverse, and many of the traits that follow depend on or result from this main concept.

By decentralization, we mean not owned or operated by a single entity or at the mercy of a few powerbrokers. Centralized platforms tend to start friendly and cooperative to attract users and developers, but once growth slows they become [competitive, extractive, and zero-sum](https://future.com/why-web3-matters/) in their relationships. Often these powerful intermediaries engage in user rights abuses and de-platforming, and they host captive economies with aggressive take-rates. Decentralized systems, on the other hand, exhibit more equitable ownership among stakeholders, reduced censorship, and greater diversity. 

### 2. Property rights

People have grown so accustomed to renting from the centralized services of web2 that the idea of actually *owning* things — digital objects you can sell, trade, or take elsewhere — often strikes people as odd. But the digital world ought to obey the same logic as the physical world: when you buy something, you own it. It’s yours. Just as courts of law uphold these rights in the physical world, so should code enforce it online. It just so happens that true digital property rights weren’t possible before the advent of cryptography, blockchain technology, and related innovations such as NFTs. Put simply, metaverses turn digital serfs into homesteaders.

### 3. Self-sovereign identity

Identity is closely related to property rights. You can’t own anything if you don’t own *yourself*. As in the real world, people’s identities must be able to persist throughout the metaverse without complete reliance on a small set of centralized identity providers.

### 4. Composability

Composability is a systems design principle, and here specifically it’s the ability [to mix and match software components like lego bricks](https://cdixon.mirror.xyz/Ie8BQeiM1JTJkKISPVaAao88-XVMoHsdUAtcnS9_Jbs). Every software component only needs to be written once, and can thereafter simply be reused. It’s analogous to [compounding interest](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1495639908517560322) in finance or Moore’s law in computing — some of the most powerful known economic forces — because of the exponential power it can unlock.

To feature [composability](https://future.com/how-composability-unlocks-crypto-and-everything-else/) — a concept closely intertwined with interoperability — a metaverse would have to offer high quality, and open, technical standards as a foundation. In their [strongest](https://cdixon.org/2019/01/08/strong-and-weak-technologies) form, composability and interoperability are possible permissionessly across wide ranges of the software stack. Decentralized finance, or DeFi, exemplifies this strong form. Anyone can adapt, recycle, change, or import existing code. By composing together powerful new ingredients like property rights, identity, and ownership, builders can create completely new experiences.

### 5. Openness/open source

True composability is impossible in the absence of [open source](https://a16z.com/2017/04/08/culture-open-source-community/), which is the practice of making code freely available and able to be redistributed and modified at will. 

So what does open source mean in a metaverse development context? The best programmers and creators — not the platforms — need full control to be fully innovative. Open source, and openness, helps ensure this. When codebases, algorithms, marketplaces, and protocols are transparent public goods, builders can pursue the fullness of their visions and ambitions to build more sophisticated, trustable experiences. 

Openness leads to more secure software, makes the economic terms more knowable to all parties, and eliminates information asymmetries. These properties can create fairer, more equitable systems that [actually align network participants](https://future.com/go-to-market-in-web3/).

The power of composability in web3 is largely due to its open source ethos.

### 6. Community ownership

In a metaverse, all stakeholders should have a say, proportionally to their involvement, in the governance of the system. People should not just have to abide by the edicts passed down by a group of product managers at a tech company. 

Community ownership is the piece of the puzzle that aligns network participants — builders, creators, investors, and users — to cooperate and strive for a common good. This miracle of coordination — previously unwieldy or not possible without the advent of crypto and blockchains — is orchestrated through the [ownership of tokens](https://future.com/tokens-are-a-new-digital-primitive/), the native assets of networks. 

### 7. Social immersion

A metaverse does not have to exist in VR/AR. All that’s necessary for a metaverse to exist is social immersion in the broad sense. What’s more important than hardware is the type of activities metaverses enable. They will let people remotely hang out, work together, mingle with friends, and have fun, much like they do using Discord, Twitter Spaces, or Clubhouse today.
