### Introduction

In this nascent phase of the Metaverse, the industry has not formed a unified standard for defining or understanding it. It is a garden in which 100 flowers are blooming and 100 schools of thought contend. 

David Bashuki, CEO of Roblox, has proposed eight elements of the Metaverse: identity, sociality, immersion, low latency, diversity, anywhere, economic system, and civilization. Renowned analyst Matthew Ball has identified six characteristics of the Metaverse: sustainability, real-time, no access restrictions, economic functions, connectivity, and creativity. Jon Radoff, founder of Beamable, has ideated seven levels of Metaverse construction: experience, discovery, creator economy, spatial computing, decentralization, human-computer interaction, and infrastructure. In China, some institutions have proposed that the Metaverse is a new internet application and social arena that integrates various new technologies, shaping a virtual space in an online world that mirrors the natural world in an increasingly realistic digital landscape. 

These different understandings and definitions of the Metaverse come from different perspectives, including experiential, technological, or regulatory interpretations. It is not easy to provide a concise, definitive, unified definition that covers all these dimensions.

#### Metaverse in popular culture

In Stephenson's dystopian view of the future, *Snow Crash*, people gained status based on the technical skill of their avatars. Another indication of status was the ability to access certain restricted environments -- a precursor to the paywalls and registration requirements some websites use today.

*Ready Player One* by Ernest Cline, later made into a movie by Steven Spielberg, was another novel that helped popularize the idea of the metaverse. The 2011 dystopian sci-fi novel is set in the year 2045, where people escape the problems plaguing Earth in a virtual world called The Oasis. Users access the world using a virtual reality visor and haptic gloves that let them grab and touch objects in the digital environment.

#### Matthew Ball 

In his best-selling [primer](https://www.matthewball.vc/metaversebook), *The Metaverse: And How It Will Revolutionize Everything*, author Matthew Ball defined the metaverse as the following:

> A massively scaled and interoperable network of real-time rendered 3D virtual worlds that can be experienced synchronously and persistently by an effectively unlimited number of users with an individual sense of presence and with continuity of data, such as identity, history, entitlements, objects, communications and payments. 

#### World Economic Forum

>  The metaverse is a future persistent and interconnected virtual environment where social and economic elements mirror reality. Users can interact with it and each other simultaneously across devices and immersive technologies while engaging with digital assets and property.

### Defining the Metaverse (OV)

Technically the original vision and definition of The Metaverse was a point in time when the blurring of a distinction between physical and digital happens. This has typically been thought of in the context of AR (Augmented Reality) and VR (Virtual Reality) otherwise known as Mixed Reality becoming ubiquitous.

However, we believe it’s important we think of it not as a destination but a journey or process.

This is because it’s important to acknowledge the beginnings of the Metaverse are already here and if we think of it as a far off destination we will sleep walk into not addressing some fundamental design choices and potentially replicate or deepen what is broken about the Web today.

It seems one of the defining characteristics of a metaverse was that somehow it was an economic system independent of, and enjoys supremacy to, old fiat based economies controlled by nation states.

If we look at Facebook’s efforts to launch its own digital currency with Libra (which would have extended to Oculus), because it is a highly centralised and fiat based company, it has been aggressively constrained and in effect neutered as a genuine disruptive and sovereign crypto-currency.

It could be considered partially true some games platforms are so big they are closed micro-economies, with their own currencies which they control centrally and value systems, like experience points systems, in-game items (skins) and marketplaces, where significant amounts of the wealth are held and traded.

But the reality is only a few even let you transact in and out of their closed platform using fiat but even more importantly, wealth is not directly transferable between these microeconomics into a virtual meta economy with its own sovereign currencies.

What’s more you can’t generally borrow against virtual wealth to buy physical assets, putting digital natives at an economic disadvantage, where 63% of gamers said they would actually spend more on skins if they had real world value.

We propose ultimately we believe the defining characteristic of a true Metaverse is that it needs its own economy and currencies native to it, where value can be earnt, spent, lent, borrowed or invested interchangeably in both a physical or virtual sense and most importantly without the need for a government.



#### What is the difference between the internet and the metaverse?

The internet is a network of billions of computers, millions of servers and other electronic devices. Once online, internet users can communicate with each other, view and interact with websites, and buy and sell goods and services.

The metaverse doesn't compete with the internet -- it builds on it. The internet is something that people "browse," but people can "live" in the metaverse to a degree. The growth of the internet has spawned many services that are leading the way to the creation of the metaverse.

"In gaming, you see Roblox, Minecraft and other immersive video games -- and even Zoom -- foreshadow what the metaverse is designed to offer," said Ben Bajarin, CEO and analyst at Creative Strategies.

*Web 3.0*, or *Web3*, is the term used to denote a new blockchain-based version of the internet.

# Metaverse vs Multiverse vs Omniverse: Which Is Here To Stay?

https://phemex.com/blogs/metaverse-vs-multiverse-vs-omniverse



With the growth of niche sub-industries like **[GameFi](https://phemex.com/academy/what-is-gamefi)** and **SocialFi**, we’re starting to see the beginning of what [**Web3** ](https://phemex.com/blogs/web-3-0)will enable. As boundaries of digital reality begin to blur, it’s important to draw and explain lines between such emerging orders. This article will take a closer look at three such concepts: the metaverse, multiverse, and omniverse.

![metaverse-vs-multiverse-vs-omniverse](https://img.phemex.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/17095650/metaverse-vs-multiverse-vs-omniverse.jpg)

## Metaverse vs Multiverse

The metaverse was first coined by Neal Stephenson in a science fiction novel that details the concept of a shared, virtual space where people can interact with each other and with digital representations of themselves (avatars). In many ways, the metaverse is similar to the Internet today.

However, to understand the **[metaverse](https://phemex.com/academy/what-is-the-metaverse-crypto)**, one must know it’s different from the Internet in that it isn’t limited to a device or screen, and will instead be incorporated into the world around us in immersive ways.

## Metaverse vs Virtual Reality

There have been heavy comparisons between the metaverse and VR, but while the metaverse is a digital space, VR is a simulated reality. In other words, VR creates an artificial environment that mimics the real world, while the metaverse is its own independent space separate from the physical world.

## Metaverse vs Augmented Reality

AR is an enhanced version of the physical world. It adds digital information on top of the real world. For example, a user can use AR to see directions superimposed on the street in front of them. The metaverse, on the other hand, is a completely separate digital space.

## What Is The Multiverse?

The multiverse is a collection of multiple universes – each with its own set of laws and rules. To put this into context, this would be akin to an individual’s activity on social media taking place in one universe while their activity on a gaming platform takes place in another.

The key element at play here is that universes within the multiverse aren’t necessarily connected to each other. There are limited options for transferring data or information between universes, with each one existing independent of the others.

Where the metaverse promotes a unified and interconnected approach, the multiverse champions a privacy-focused, secure, yet fragmented experience. Web2 is quite similar to a multiverse system, with many siloed platforms that are disconnected from each other.

## What Is The Omniverse?

The omniverse is the sum of all universes — both real and imagined. This includes everything from the universe to parallel universes and fictional universes. Essentially, it’s the ultimate reality.

## What Are The Differences?

### Infinite vs. Finite

The main difference between all these terms is that the omniverse is infinite, whereas the metaverse and multiverse are finite. The omniverse also contains an infinite number of universes, while the metaverse and multiverse each contain a finite number.

### Concepts

Another key difference is that the metaverse and multiverse are both man-made concepts, whereas the omniverse is a natural concept. The metaverse and multiverse are created by people through their actions and interactions in digital space. The omniverse, on the other hand, has always existed — it’s the sum total of all reality.

The metaverse and multiverse can be viewed as two sides of the same coin i.e., different ways of looking at the same thing. The metaverse is a unified, interconnected space, while the multiverse is a collection of disparate universes. The omniverse, on the other hand, is the sum of all realities – both within the metaverse and the multiverse.

## What Are The Similarities?

### Every interaction leaves a digital trace

The three concepts all technically include virtual realities created by people through their interactions in digital space. This means that every interaction performed in the metaverse, multiverse, or omniverse leaves a digital trace.

### An endless array of possibilities

Another similarity is that all three concepts are open-ended and ever-expanding. As concepts, the metaverse, multiverse, and omniverse are all constantly growing and evolving. Additionally, all three concepts contain an infinite number of possibilities. The metaverse, multiverse, and omniverse each offer an endless array of possibilities for exploration and discovery.

### User identity

Lastly, all three concepts are connected with user identity. This means that one’s activity in one universe will be linked with one’s activity in another. For example, if an individual plays a game on one platform, their avatar will be the same as the one they use on another platform. Similarly, if someone makes a purchase on one website, their digital user identity will be linked with that purchase in one way or another.

## The Current Scenario

The industry’s in a ‘metaverse race’ where every major enterprise is competing to create its own corner of the metaverse. Some of the most prominent players include Meta, Google, and Microsoft.

**[NFTs](https://phemex.com/academy/what-are-non-fungible-tokens-nfts)** are considered as an experimental investment with massive potential, but these digital assets are the key differentiating feature among users in the metaverse era. The major use cases of NFTs include gaming, digital art, and collectibles. [**NFTs in the metaverse**](https://phemex.com/academy/what-is-metaverse-nft) play an important role in the rapidly growing crypto economy.

The biggest challenge for metaverse builders to overcome is the lack of platform interoperability. Currently, each platform exists in its own silo with no connection to the others. This fragmentation is a major hindrance to the metaverse’s growth.

## Conclusion

The metaverse era is still in its early stages, and it remains to be seen how it will develop over time. However, one thing is certain – as a concept, the metaverse is here to stay.
