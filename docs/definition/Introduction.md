# Introduction

In this nascent phase of the Metaverse, the industry has not formed a unified standard for defining or understanding it. It is a garden in which 100 flowers are blooming and 100 schools of thought contend. 

David Bashuki, CEO of Roblox, has proposed eight elements of the Metaverse: identity, sociality, immersion, low latency, diversity, anywhere, economic system, and civilization. Renowned analyst Matthew Ball has identified six characteristics of the Metaverse: sustainability, real-time, no access restrictions, economic functions, connectivity, and creativity. Jon Radoff, founder of Beamable, has ideated seven levels of Metaverse construction: experience, discovery, creator economy, spatial computing, decentralization, human-computer interaction, and infrastructure. In China, some institutions have proposed that the Metaverse is a new internet application and social arena that integrates various new technologies, shaping a virtual space in an online world that mirrors the natural world in an increasingly realistic digital landscape. 

These different understandings and definitions of the Metaverse come from different perspectives, including experiential, technological, or regulatory interpretations. It is not easy to provide a concise, definitive, unified definition that covers all these dimensions. 

## Metaverse in popular culture

In Stephenson's dystopian view of the future, *Snow Crash*, people gained status based on the technical skill of their avatars. Another indication of status was the ability to access certain restricted environments -- a precursor to the paywalls and registration requirements some websites use today.

*Ready Player One* by Ernest Cline, later made into a movie by Steven Spielberg, was another novel that helped popularize the idea of the metaverse. The 2011 dystopian sci-fi novel is set in the year 2045, where people escape the problems plaguing Earth in a virtual world called The Oasis. Users access the world using a virtual reality visor and haptic gloves that let them grab and touch objects in the digital environment.

## Matthew Ball 

In his best-selling [primer](https://www.matthewball.vc/metaversebook), *The Metaverse: And How It Will Revolutionize Everything*, author Matthew Ball defined the metaverse as the following:

> A massively scaled and interoperable network of real-time rendered 3D virtual worlds that can be experienced synchronously and persistently by an effectively unlimited number of users with an individual sense of presence and with continuity of data, such as identity, history, entitlements, objects, communications and payments. 

### Defining the Metaverse (OV)

Technically the original vision and definition of The Metaverse was a point in time when the blurring of a distinction between physical and digital happens. This has typically been thought of in the context of AR (Augmented Reality) and VR (Virtual Reality) otherwise known as Mixed Reality becoming ubiquitous.

However, we believe it’s important we think of it not as a destination but a journey or process.

This is because it’s important to acknowledge the beginnings of the Metaverse are already here and if we think of it as a far off destination we will sleep walk into not addressing some fundamental design choices and potentially replicate or deepen what is broken about the Web today.

It seems one of the defining characteristics of a metaverse was that somehow it was an economic system independent of, and enjoys supremacy to, old fiat based economies controlled by nation states.

If we look at Facebook’s efforts to launch its own digital currency with Libra (which would have extended to Oculus), because it is a highly centralised and fiat based company, it has been aggressively constrained and in effect neutered as a genuine disruptive and sovereign crypto-currency.

It could be considered partially true some games platforms are so big they are closed micro-economies, with their own currencies which they control centrally and value systems, like experience points systems, in-game items (skins) and marketplaces, where significant amounts of the wealth are held and traded.

But the reality is only a few even let you transact in and out of their closed platform using fiat but even more importantly, wealth is not directly transferable between these microeconomics into a virtual meta economy with its own sovereign currencies.

What’s more you can’t generally borrow against virtual wealth to buy physical assets, putting digital natives at an economic disadvantage, where 63% of gamers said they would actually spend more on skins if they had real world value.

We propose ultimately we believe the defining characteristic of a true Metaverse is that it needs its own economy and currencies native to it, where value can be earnt, spent, lent, borrowed or invested interchangeably in both a physical or virtual sense and most importantly without the need for a government.

>  The metaverse is a future persistent and interconnected virtual environment where social and economic elements mirror reality. Users can interact with it and each other simultaneously across devices and immersive technologies while engaging with digital assets and property.

## What is the difference between the internet and the metaverse?

The internet is a network of billions of computers, millions of servers and other electronic devices. Once online, internet users can communicate with each other, view and interact with websites, and buy and sell goods and services.

The metaverse doesn't compete with the internet -- it builds on it. The internet is something that people "browse," but people can "live" in the metaverse to a degree. The growth of the internet has spawned many services that are leading the way to the creation of the metaverse.

"In gaming, you see Roblox, Minecraft and other immersive video games -- and even Zoom -- foreshadow what the metaverse is designed to offer," said Ben Bajarin, CEO and analyst at Creative Strategies.

*Web 3.0*, or *Web3*, is the term used to denote a new blockchain-based version of the internet. "[Web 3.0 vs. metaverse: How are they different](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/Web3-vs-metaverse-Whats-the-difference)?" unpacks the links and distinctions between the two concepts and explains how a decentralized Web3 aims to give users more control over their browsing experience.
