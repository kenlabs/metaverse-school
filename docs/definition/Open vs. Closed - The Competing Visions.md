# Open vs. Closed - The Competing Visions

### Are there competing visions for the Metaverse?

It is true there are competing visions for the Metaverse and it is not yet clear if they can and will co-exist or must be in competition. To put it simply there are at least two versions of the Metaverse we observe emerging: one dominated by closed platforms and Big Tech like Facebook / Oculus and the other built on open protocols leveraging blockchains like Decentraland.

But the distinction of open and closed isn’t just limited to technology choices and the extent to which platforms embrace open source principles with their code and data but importantly whether they have a closed economy, within or across their own proprietary games, or whether they allow transferability of value outside their ecosystem, how that interacts with fiat based systems and to what extent they do or don’t control the monetary and fiscal policy of the underlying economy itself.

Furthermore, there is also another technical and philosophical distinction between visions and emergent actualities of metaverses which could be described as: low-fi to hi-fi. There are platforms that deliberately push the technical boundaries of the experience through both software and the hardware requirements like Oculus and those that design for the lowest possible device and bandwidth requirements for universal accessibility like Cryptovoxels. Although it must be said to our knowledge all of these virtual worlds still require at least a smart phone which still currently excludes 6/10 of the global population.

You can take these as a form of axes which allow for a crude classification of metaverse platforms and virtual worlds to emerge. We believe these two axes are the most important to consider because when combined they represent the cost to enter the economic system and the ability to off-set that cost by earning value for different demographics.

It could be said there is a third classification about whether the platform allows for user generated content or not, but we think this difference will fade away with time. Most platforms to varying degrees will allow for UGC like Roblox or Minecraft, and will fall under the degree to which the virtual world is generally ‘open’, so UGC is not important as a separate dimension when looking to project into the future of the metaverse.

It is our belief, and the thesis of this paper, that with time (the one thing we don’t answer is how long) an open metaverse built on shared open source protocols, open infrastructure and a single unifying yet open financial system will erode, or ‘eat’, and potentially replace closed platforms due to powerful network effects. Leaving the only remaining distinction between virtual worlds; if they are low-fi or hi-fi. This final point is important and something that we believe we as an industry should always maintain in order to be as inclusive as possible and onboard as many people out of the old economy and into The Open Metaverse.



### 7 Essential Ingredients of an Open Metaverse

There has been a lot of buzz about “the metaverse” since its coinage in the ‘90s, but especially during the pandemic (given the surge in online activity), and even more so after Facebook changed its name to Meta. 

Is this just a bit of opaque marketing-speak? What is a *metaverse* exactly? How does one define the term, and where does one draw a line between a metaverse and, say, just another virtual world? These are common questions that people ask about the metaverse, so we thought we’d outline how we see it and how the metaverse intersects with web3. 

In many ways, the metaverse is just another name for evolving the internet: to be more social, immersive, and far more economically sophisticated than what exists today. There are, broadly speaking, two competing visions for how to bring this about: One is decentralized, generous with property rights and new frontiers, interoperable, open, and owned by the communities that build and maintain it. The other vision — too familiar to many people today — is centralized, closed, subject to the whims of corporations; and often extracts painful economic rents from its creators, contributors, and inhabitants.

The key dimension to compare these two visions is open vs closed, and the differences between them can be conceptualized as follows:

![img](https://future.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Metaverse-framework-In-line.jpeg)

An open metaverse is decentralized, allows users to control identity, enforces property rights, aligns incentives, and ensures value accrues to users (not platforms). An open metaverse is also transparent, permissionless, interoperable, and composable (others can freely build within and across metaverses), among other criteria. 

Achieving a “true” metaverse — one that’s open versus closed — requires seven essential ingredients intrinsic to this sought-after state. We argue that these are necessary to meet the minimum requirement to be called a metaverse. Our goal is to clear the fog of misinformation about what is and isn’t a true metaverse for builders and would-be participants, and to provide a framework for evaluating early metaverse attempts.

### 1. Decentralization

[Decentralization](https://future.com/web3-decentralization-models-framework-principles-how-to/) is the overarching, governing principle of a proper metaverse, and many of the traits that follow depend on or result from this main concept.

By decentralization, we mean not owned or operated by a single entity or at the mercy of a few powerbrokers. Centralized platforms tend to start friendly and cooperative to attract users and developers, but once growth slows they become [competitive, extractive, and zero-sum](https://future.com/why-web3-matters/) in their relationships. Often these powerful intermediaries engage in user rights abuses and de-platforming, and they host captive economies with aggressive take-rates. Decentralized systems, on the other hand, exhibit more equitable ownership among stakeholders, reduced censorship, and greater diversity. 

[Decentralization matters](https://cdixon.org/2018/02/18/why-decentralization-matters). Without it, anyone can get “rugged” at any time — a precarious situation that dissuades people from building on top, hampering innovation. Because centralized platforms cannot make the same kinds of [strong commitments](https://a16z.com/2020/01/27/computers-that-make-commitments/) — controlled by code — that blockchains can, their promises can be revoked or altered whenever an arrangement no longer makes sense to the whims of leaders or organizations. The strongest way to protect against such abuses and secure a metaverse is to ensure that control is decentralized.

### 2. Property rights

Most successful video games today make money by selling in-game items, like “skins”, “emotes”, and other digital goods. But people who currently buy in-game items aren’t actually *buying* items – they’re *renting* them. As soon as anyone leaves for a different game — or the game in question unilaterally decides to shut down or switch up the rules — players lose access. 

People have grown so accustomed to renting from the centralized services of web2 that the idea of actually *owning* things — digital objects you can sell, trade, or take elsewhere — often strikes people as odd. But the digital world ought to obey the same logic as the physical world: when you buy something, you own it. It’s yours. Just as courts of law uphold these rights in the physical world, so should code enforce it online. It just so happens that true digital property rights weren’t possible before the advent of cryptography, blockchain technology, and related innovations such as NFTs. Put simply, metaverses turn digital serfs into homesteaders.

### 3. Self-sovereign identity

Identity is closely related to property rights. You can’t own anything if you don’t own *yourself*. As in the real world, people’s identities must be able to persist throughout the metaverse without complete reliance on a small set of centralized identity providers.

Authentication is about identity: proving who a person is, what they have access to, and what information they share. On the web today, this requires asking an intermediary to do so on one’s behalf with popular one-click login methods like social login or single sign-on (SSO). Today’s biggest tech platforms, like Meta and Google, use this approach to collect data to build their businesses: monitoring people’s behavior to develop models that serve more relevant ads. In addition, because these platforms have complete control, trying to innovate on the authentication process relies on the honesty and willingness of the corporation behind the platform.

The cryptography at the core of web3 enables people to [authenticate without relying on these intermediaries](https://a16z.com/2022/04/21/investing-in-spruce/), so people can control their identity directly or with the help of services they choose. Wallets (like Metamask and Phantom) provide ways for people to verify themselves. Standards like EIP-4361 ([Sign-in with Ethereum](https://login.xyz/)) and ENS (Ethereum Name Service) allow projects to coordinate around open source protocols and [contribute independently](https://twitter.com/wycdd/status/1514280520078737411) to a richer, more secure, and continually evolving concept of digital identity.

### 4. Composability

Composability is a systems design principle, and here specifically it’s the ability [to mix and match software components like lego bricks](https://cdixon.mirror.xyz/Ie8BQeiM1JTJkKISPVaAao88-XVMoHsdUAtcnS9_Jbs). Every software component only needs to be written once, and can thereafter simply be reused. It’s analogous to [compounding interest](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1495639908517560322) in finance or Moore’s law in computing — some of the most powerful known economic forces — because of the exponential power it can unlock.

To feature [composability](https://future.com/how-composability-unlocks-crypto-and-everything-else/) — a concept closely intertwined with interoperability — a metaverse would have to offer high quality, and open, technical standards as a foundation. In games like Minecraft and Roblox, you can build digital goods and new experiences out of the basic components supplied by the system, but it’s harder to move them outside that context or modify their inner workings. Companies offering embeddable services, like Stripe for payments or Twilio for communications, work across websites and apps — but they don’t allow outside developers to change or remix their black boxes of code.

In their [strongest](https://cdixon.org/2019/01/08/strong-and-weak-technologies) form, composability and interoperability are possible permissionessly across wide ranges of the software stack. Decentralized finance, or DeFi, exemplifies this strong form. Anyone can adapt, recycle, change, or import existing code. Not only that, developers can build on live programs — such as Compound’s lending protocols or Uniswap’s automated market-making exchanges — at their leisure, side-by-side in the memory of a shared virtual computer (Ethereum). By composing together powerful new ingredients like property rights, identity, and ownership, builders can create completely new experiences.

### 5. Openness/open source

True composability is impossible in the absence of [open source](https://a16z.com/2017/04/08/culture-open-source-community/), which is the practice of making code freely available and able to be redistributed and modified at will. Regardless of degree or kind, open source as a principle is so essential to the development of a metaverse, that we’ve broken it out as its own separate ingredient despite the overlap with composability above. 

So what does open source mean in a metaverse development context? The best programmers and creators — not the platforms — need full control to be fully innovative. Open source, and openness, helps ensure this. When codebases, algorithms, marketplaces, and protocols are transparent public goods, builders can pursue the fullness of their visions and ambitions to build more sophisticated, trustable experiences. 

Openness leads to more secure software, makes the economic terms more knowable to all parties, and eliminates information asymmetries. These properties can create fairer, more equitable systems that [actually align network participants](https://future.com/go-to-market-in-web3/). They could also even [obviate the need](https://future.com/web3-decentralization-models-framework-principles-how-to/) for outdated U.S. securities laws, which were designed decades ago to reconcile the longstanding [principal-agent problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal–agent_problem) and information asymmetries in business.

The power of composability in web3 is largely due to its open source ethos.

### 6. Community ownership

In a metaverse, all stakeholders should have a say, proportionally to their involvement, in the governance of the system. People should not just have to abide by the edicts passed down by a group of product managers at a tech company. If any one entity owns or controls this virtual world, then much like Disney World, it may offer a certain form of contained escapism but will never live up to its [true potential](https://future.com/crypto-and-community-owned-characters/). 

Community ownership is the piece of the puzzle that aligns network participants — builders, creators, investors, and users — to cooperate and strive for a common good. This miracle of coordination — previously unwieldy or not possible without the advent of crypto and blockchains — is orchestrated through the [ownership of tokens](https://future.com/tokens-are-a-new-digital-primitive/), the native assets of networks. 

Beyond the technological advancements created by decentralization, the philosophical implications of a community-owned space is crucial to the success of the metaverse. Across web3, participants in decentralized autonomous organizations, or [DAOs](https://future.com/dao-canon/), have taken this principle to heart. They are eschewing the formal rigidity of corporate structures in favor of more flexible, more varied democratic, and informal experiments in governance. This allows for communities that are governed, built, and driven forward by their users, rather than by a single entity.

### 7. Social immersion

Big tech companies would have you believe that high-powered virtual reality or augmented reality (VR/AR) hardware is an essential — perhaps even the most essential — ingredient in a metaverse. This is because those devices are a trojan horse. Corporations see them as a way to becoming the dominant computing interface suppliers for 3D virtual worlds, and thereby also becoming the choke points that intermediate people’s metaverse experiences. 

A metaverse does not have to exist in VR/AR. All that’s necessary for a metaverse to exist is social immersion in the broad sense. What’s more important than hardware is the type of activities metaverses enable. They will let people remotely hang out, work together, mingle with friends, and have fun, much like they do using Discord, Twitter Spaces, or Clubhouse today.

The pandemic underscored the need for more immersive experiences — beyond traditional text based communication platforms, such as email — as the use of other remote conferencing and telepresence tools, like Zoom and others, soared. Further, because of the economic elements outlined earlier — property rights, self-sovereignty, community ownership — metaverses can enable people to make a living, engage in business, and attain status. In a typical knowledge worker’s workplace, people collaborate using tools like Slack, while outside the traditional corporate world in the bottom-up organizational movement of DAOs, Discord and Telegram prevail.

The metaverse has nothing to do with “view” modalities — the tools you use to see the metaverse. That’s a convenient meme for those who have control over manufacturing hardware. 



### Openverse · ETHGlobal Showcase

The open, permissionless and user-owned AR/VR metaverse of the future
https://showcase.ethglobal.com/ethonline/openverse



We are building the open, permissionless and user-owned metaverse of the future. Here's why we need it today: 

1. Facebook controls a large market share of the VR hardware market with Oculus. Recently, it has decided to force its users to sign in with a Facebook account rather than a separate Oculus account, causing some users to even be locked out of using their headsets if their Facebook account was deemed "suspicious". The plan for Facebook here is obvious - to monetize the attention of users in VR headsets with advertisements. 
2. We believe that for an open Web ecosystem to thrive, we need alternative methods of monetizing experiences and content in a way that is not extractive from the user, but provides ways for the users of said experiences to benefit in a way that is non zero-sum. 
3. One of the best ways in which experiences and content creators can create such forward-looking communities, is through a decentralized form of ownership, in which all participants of the network benefit from the overall network's growth.
4. Openverse is the technological manifestation of these values. We are focused on AR/VR because we believe that XR not only enhances the feeling of presence in a social setting between two people, but it also strengthens the notion of ownership of a particular virtual good through the ability to virtually "hold" an item.

# So why build in the Open Metaverse?

https://outlierventures.io/research/so-why-build-in-the-open-metaverse/

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5G7wzW8I4c



Well firstly there is a general direction of travel towards open standards in the Metaverse even by what you might at first glance regard as it’s closed participants including:

**Open 3D object media standards:** There are a number of now well established standards around 3D object media including Pixar’s USD (Universal Screen Description) and NVIDIA’s MDL (Material Definition Language), and NVIDIA’s Omniverse (Open Beta) and GLTF.

**Metaverse Web Browsers:** There are increasing in-browser capabilities being developed from Google Gaming Browser and Mozilla VR, with WebGL now widely supported and WebXR on the verge of enabling generic support to VR and AR devices, as well as crypto-currency browser wallets like Metamask. Although we are not quite there with seamless in-world transactions.

But also as alluded to earlier we believe there will be both top-down and bottom-up reasons driving a move towards openness. Let’s start with bottom-up because we believe this will be the primary driver for innovation in its early stages. As described the principle of self-sovereignty, the sovereignty of identity, and associated digital wealth (including assets and increasingly data) are based on the concept of user-centricity: where a user takes precedence over any given platform. Where some may argue the user in aggregate is the platform. In this context virtual worlds become the interface to create, trade or experience virtual goods and services which are portable and not restricted to a single platform. This is a powerful economic driver and a fundamental paradigm shift away from the Closed Metaverse and its business models we see dominate the Web today.

When creations, wealth, and assets can have a life ‘off platform’ and be exchanged and become infinitely interchangeable with one another, freely in open markets, they grow in liquidity and consequently value, simply because more value can be exchanged between itself without limitation. You could consider it a ‘value squared’.

![img](https://outlierventures.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-02-05-at-17.57.40.png)

Many creators like artists are experiencing this for the first time where assets with NFTs (Non Fungible Tokens) are sold for more off-platform in secondary markets than in their primary sale (where they are minted). And this will be extended even further as we develop standards for royalties and can be to translate memes themselves into forms of social currencies rewarding not just the creation of a thing, but its value chain of evolution and amplification through sharing in social channels. This brings powerful network effects not experienced in closed systems and it is our belief as creators, and this increasingly includes established popular brand franchises looking to new mediums to monetise their assets, begin to follow the money the open virtual worlds that allow for economic interoperability will win out.

And we are already seeing early but increasing forms of integrations of The Open Metaverse OS into established social channels like Discord including crypto wallets and NFT marketplaces and exchanges. Discord brings with it 250m+ gamers who will most likely first experience Web 3 technologies, and the Open Metaverse economic layer, without ever leaving Discord. It’s important to remember Discord’s rise coincided with the growth of e-sports, through games like League of Legends, Overwatch and Fortnite which all initially had limited communication tools for streaming, which Discord elegantly solved outside of those closed worlds in an open environment. And the same is happening with nascent Open Metaverse virtual worlds like Decentraland, which at the time of writing does not support in world audio requiring in world events to use Discord for the audio streaming. So cross-world social, and increasingly economic layers, will run in parallel to virtual worlds initially until they become embedded with them. But even once these limitations are resolved in these new virtual worlds discord is likely to continue being the social layer around and between worlds and likely to play host to the convergence of Web 3 & gaming communities.

We can also regard different virtual worlds, open or closed, as slices of a larger whole. Users can and will by design interact with and be part of one or more of these worlds. And whilst a single world could outgrow all others and become a significant part of the Multiverse they do not enjoy the same defensible ‘moats’ seen in Web 2 of locking users and their data into their platforms and holding them ransom. The only challenge to this being closed hardware that is so desirable and performant end-users will tolerate a more closed approach as has been seen with Apple. That aside this could be a significant break from the cycles of bundling and unbundling we typically see in internet based technology paradigms. And the only real moat can be the degree of openness, economic incentive design and verified trust in the rules of the virtual world.

This later point around incentives is critical because one of the powerful things about blockchains as we have seen with Bitcoin, Ethereum and its various DeFi protocols is you can hardcode economic incentives for early adopters to join a network into the system itself. Bootstrapping adoption, compute power and storage or even financial capital to develop the network. And we are seeing this with many early virtual worlds both creating their own crypto currency or selling virtual land, or offering NFTs as rewards all of which is easily tradable off platform with and for other crypto currencies. In effect the Open Metaverse is its own bank and can create any number of incentives and games to grow adoption.

Therefore it is more likely virtual worlds in The Open Metaverse are increasingly interoperable and interconnected to the point it will be hard to distinguish them as separate but rather different instances of a whole.







### Are there competing visions for the Metaverse?

It is true there are competing visions for the Metaverse and it is not yet clear if they can and will co-exist or must be in competition.
