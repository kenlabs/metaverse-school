Metaverse, Multiverse, and Omniverse; all three concepts are connected to each other but have very different features altogether. These concepts enable the idea of connectivity, massive data handling, data transfer, etc but also separate entities of operations from each other. However, there are factors that are increasing the popularity of these concepts and these factors are increasing digital connectivity of users from all over the world, the demand for more comfortable technologies, the demand for increasing virtual techs, and more. These increasing demands are resulting in an increasing amount of data and thus, the requirement for better connectivity is increasing as well.

#### What is Metaverse?

Now, before we proceed to discuss the differences between Metaverse vs Multiverse vs Omniverse, it would be better to understand these three concepts separately. So, let’s begin with the concept of the Metaverse first.

Metaverse is a concept that leverages virtual objects to offer realistic experiences by using technologies such as blockchain, AR, VR, AI, IoT, and more. Metaverse users have the freedom to buy virtual spaces to create virtual stores. Apart from that, users can also use VR glasses just to roam around in the Metaverse and do activities like hanging out with friends, finding new people, exploring stores, purchasing stuff, playing video games, [marketing in Metaverse](https://mention.com/en/blog/marketing-in-the-metaverse/), etc.

To put it in short, Metaverse is a replica of the real universe that you get to explore and experience from the comfort of your own home. By leveraging technologies like AR and VR, you see and interact with objects that are just graphical representations of something that are either imaginary or copies of something real.

The above statistics by [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1280565/global-market-cap-metaverse-facebook-gaming/) show that Web 2.0 Metaverse had the largest market capitalization by October 2021. With a whopping 14.8 trillion USD market capitalization, the margin was way higher than the capitalization of other leading Metaverse segments like gaming and eSports, and Facebook (Meta).

#### What is Multiverse?

As the name suggests, Multiverse is a combination of two words- Multiple + Universes. Thus, Multiverse simply means a collection of multiple universes that you can theorize, explore, or experience. In the real world, the Multiverse term is used to describe many fictional universes but in the context of technologies, the meaning slightly differs. In the technological world, there are several platforms that are referred to as various universes. For instance, social media platforms are one universe, and gaming platforms are the other universe. Just like that, you have one universe called eCommerce platforms and another universe where you order food from.

Multiverse is a simple concept to understand. Whatever you do in your video games will not impact your social media content. But some games like Uno provide you with the ability to share your gaming achievements on your social media platforms. That is how you transfer data between two different universes. But because both universes are part of a single Multiverse, it is possible to do that. However, you can not forget that even after being a part of the single Multiverse, both universes have their own set of rules and regulations that are not going to impact one another.

#### What is Omniverse?

Omniverse is a concept that consists of everything from Multiverses to Metaverses. It is the largest existing concept in the technological world that includes all elements of Multiverses and Metaveverses. The concept allows connecting all Metaverses and Multiverses for better data transfer, technology sharing, collaborations, communications, group projects, remote working, etc. So, in short, it is the largest amount of data collected under a single universe that keeps increasing in parallel as the number of Multiverses and Metaverses increases.

#### Difference between Metaverse, Multiverse, and Omniverse

https://hub.batoi.com/techreview/metaverse-vs-omniverse-vs-multiverse-differences-62fceb7bc54e3

Facebook’s Metaverse reflects its vision of a future that will be lived in cyberspace along with life in the physical space. The enabling technologies are augmented and virtual reality, sensors, displays, [artificial intelligence](https://hub.batoi.com/techreview/the-goods-bads-ai-61a0a728bdccfe), and digital twins. Industries are shifting operations to cyberspace because of low transaction costs and improved efficiency. The increasing usage of [digital twins](https://hub.batoi.com/techreview/everything-need-know-digital-twins-security-626e6cf85eec4) in design, manufacturing, operations, and customer demonstrates a kind of metaverse.

NVIDIA's Omniverse is a metaverse populated by Industrial Digital Twins, which are autonomous (virtual) robots allowing organizations to develop anything in the virtual world with all limitations and intricacies of the physical space.

The below table shows vital differences between both universes:

| Key Metrics         | Metaverse                                                    | Omniverse                                                    |
| :------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Definition          | The metaverse is analogous to the universe in terms of digital reality. | In comparison, the Omniverse is a superset or collection of all existing worlds in terms of digital existence and technology. |
| Integrated Platform | Summarize the virtual presence of digitalized community or individuality. | Omniverse refers to everything, that is, the ultimate (final) existence. |
| Standards/Criteria  | The metaverse may not have its own set of norms distinct from each other. | Omniverse contains all the existing metaverses that operate according to specific parameters. |
| Current Status      | The metaverse is the lowest level of the digital world, for example, Google Metaverse, Facebook Metaverse, and so on. | The Omniverse, on the other hand, is at the highest level of the digital world and contains all metaverses. |
| Interoperability    | According to user demand, metaverse groups may or may not unite. | The simplicity of sharing, operationality, technology transfer, and much more are made possible by combining all of the Metaverses. |



##### Data size

On the basis of data size, it is quite easy to understand that **Metaverse** remains at the lowest level if we compare the sizes of the data that each concept has to store and trade. After all, Metaverse is a collection of data from different sources but still only defines a single universe. It talks about a space where different entities sign up to provide common users with [top Metaverse projects](https://appinventiv.com/blog/what-is-metaverse/) based on experiences like entertainment, shopping, education, and more. However, all that is done in a single space that might nor might not expand as requirements rise.

**Multiverse**, on the other hand, is much greater than Metaverse in terms of the size and capacity of storing the data and allowing data trades. The reason, as mentioned earlier, is quite simple. It consists of multiple Metaverses, and each Metaverse has its own set of rules, regulations, and behaviors. However, the concept is not only limited to Metaverses. In fact, Multiverse is also applied in many fictional sagas, theories, etc.

**Omniverse**, as we understood earlier, is much more complex and massive in size compared to the Metaverse and Multiverse. Omniverse includes all possible Multiverses existing in the reality, and as Metaverses are part of those Multiverses, Omniverse easily takes the cup of having much more amount of data to store and trade. An Omniverse also supports the concept of enhanced connectivity and data transfer as it creates an environment where everything exists inside of the concept. So, if someone is controlling the Omniverse, then they get access to the information that is existing in all possible parallel storages of data inside the Omniverse.



##### Technological requirements

On the basis of technological requirements, **Metaverse**, as we mentioned earlier uses various technologies like AI, AR, VR, Blockchain, etc. These technologies are used to enable some common Metaverse operations like data storage, security, trading, virtual interactions, cyber security, financial transactions, content ownership, virtual shopping, and more. As new users sign up, new companies get onboarded, and new evolutions are made on Metaverse, the amount of data and the requirement of such technologies increase. But even after all that, a Metaverse still does not match the requirements of Multiverses.

A **Multiverse**, as it is massive in size, requires larger computational resources that can also enable more storage and more data transfer. Not only that, with such a massive requirement, data transfer speed is also a concern that not an ordinary internet speed can do even if it matches the level of corporate requirements. Depending on the size of the Multiverse of Metaverses, demand for technologies like blockchain and AI is surely expected to increase. Thus, these demands will result in requiring more infrastructure buildings for such technologies.

An **Omniverse** is what tops the hierarchy in terms of technical requirements due to its size. The concept covers all Multiverses, and that feature enables easiness of connectivity, one governance over the entire data infrastructure, faster connectivity of different platforms, and more. With all these capabilities, Omniverse also raises the requirement for technologies to support all these operations.

“The Metaverse is a massively scaled and interoperable network of real-time rendered 3D virtual worlds which can be experienced synchronously and persistently by an effectively unlimited number of users with an individual sense of presence, and with continuity of data, such as identity, history, entitlements, objects, communications, and payments.”

### Eight Criteria for the open Metaverse

TODO: https://medium.com/allthingsweb-blog/how-we-think-about-the-metaverse-374085b9e90



### Understanding the Metaverse

To us, the Metaverse is an evolution of the internet. We believe people will say “I am in the Metaverse” when they spend a significant amount of time and money in a digital space, and may even have a job that pays them to do things in the digital space.

Core elements of the Metaverse are the ability to meet and interact with others, participate in an open digital economy, and move fluently between interconnected experiences and applications. The Metaverse will be immersive which allows people to experience a sense of presence.

What is intellectually exciting is recognising that the Metaverse combines technologies like web technologies, 3D engines, digital identity, social networking, cloud computing, online games, VR/AR, and crypto-assets. All of which have been moving along relatively siloed development paths — until now. The Metaverse will be built on technologies of web1, web2, and web3.

We believe the Metaverse will consist of **interconnected spaces in which humans interact with a sense of presence**, and will enjoy experiences and applications.

It must be an **open, composable stack and run on a massively-scaled, resilient infrastructure that enables real-time interactions**.

# Metaverse vs Multiverse vs Omniverse: Which Is Here To Stay?

https://phemex.com/blogs/metaverse-vs-multiverse-vs-omniverse



With the growth of niche sub-industries like **[GameFi](https://phemex.com/academy/what-is-gamefi)** and **SocialFi**, we’re starting to see the beginning of what [**Web3** ](https://phemex.com/blogs/web-3-0)will enable. As boundaries of digital reality begin to blur, it’s important to draw and explain lines between such emerging orders. This article will take a closer look at three such concepts: the metaverse, multiverse, and omniverse.

![metaverse-vs-multiverse-vs-omniverse](https://img.phemex.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/17095650/metaverse-vs-multiverse-vs-omniverse.jpg)

## Metaverse vs Multiverse

The metaverse was first coined by Neal Stephenson in a science fiction novel that details the concept of a shared, virtual space where people can interact with each other and with digital representations of themselves (avatars). In many ways, the metaverse is similar to the Internet today.

However, to understand the **[metaverse](https://phemex.com/academy/what-is-the-metaverse-crypto)**, one must know it’s different from the Internet in that it isn’t limited to a device or screen, and will instead be incorporated into the world around us in immersive ways.

## Metaverse vs Virtual Reality

There have been heavy comparisons between the metaverse and VR, but while the metaverse is a digital space, VR is a simulated reality. In other words, VR creates an artificial environment that mimics the real world, while the metaverse is its own independent space separate from the physical world.

## Metaverse vs Augmented Reality

AR is an enhanced version of the physical world. It adds digital information on top of the real world. For example, a user can use AR to see directions superimposed on the street in front of them. The metaverse, on the other hand, is a completely separate digital space.

## What Is The Multiverse?

The multiverse is a collection of multiple universes – each with its own set of laws and rules. To put this into context, this would be akin to an individual’s activity on social media taking place in one universe while their activity on a gaming platform takes place in another.

The key element at play here is that universes within the multiverse aren’t necessarily connected to each other. There are limited options for transferring data or information between universes, with each one existing independent of the others.

Where the metaverse promotes a unified and interconnected approach, the multiverse champions a privacy-focused, secure, yet fragmented experience. Web2 is quite similar to a multiverse system, with many siloed platforms that are disconnected from each other.

## What Is The Omniverse?

The omniverse is the sum of all universes — both real and imagined. This includes everything from the universe to parallel universes and fictional universes. Essentially, it’s the ultimate reality.

## What Are The Differences?

### Infinite vs. Finite

The main difference between all these terms is that the omniverse is infinite, whereas the metaverse and multiverse are finite. The omniverse also contains an infinite number of universes, while the metaverse and multiverse each contain a finite number.

### Concepts

Another key difference is that the metaverse and multiverse are both man-made concepts, whereas the omniverse is a natural concept. The metaverse and multiverse are created by people through their actions and interactions in digital space. The omniverse, on the other hand, has always existed — it’s the sum total of all reality.

The metaverse and multiverse can be viewed as two sides of the same coin i.e., different ways of looking at the same thing. The metaverse is a unified, interconnected space, while the multiverse is a collection of disparate universes. The omniverse, on the other hand, is the sum of all realities – both within the metaverse and the multiverse.

## What Are The Similarities?

### Every interaction leaves a digital trace

The three concepts all technically include virtual realities created by people through their interactions in digital space. This means that every interaction performed in the metaverse, multiverse, or omniverse leaves a digital trace.

### An endless array of possibilities

Another similarity is that all three concepts are open-ended and ever-expanding. As concepts, the metaverse, multiverse, and omniverse are all constantly growing and evolving. Additionally, all three concepts contain an infinite number of possibilities. The metaverse, multiverse, and omniverse each offer an endless array of possibilities for exploration and discovery.

### User identity

Lastly, all three concepts are connected with user identity. This means that one’s activity in one universe will be linked with one’s activity in another. For example, if an individual plays a game on one platform, their avatar will be the same as the one they use on another platform. Similarly, if someone makes a purchase on one website, their digital user identity will be linked with that purchase in one way or another.

## The Current Scenario

The industry’s in a ‘metaverse race’ where every major enterprise is competing to create its own corner of the metaverse. Some of the most prominent players include Meta, Google, and Microsoft.

**[NFTs](https://phemex.com/academy/what-are-non-fungible-tokens-nfts)** are considered as an experimental investment with massive potential, but these digital assets are the key differentiating feature among users in the metaverse era. The major use cases of NFTs include gaming, digital art, and collectibles. [**NFTs in the metaverse**](https://phemex.com/academy/what-is-metaverse-nft) play an important role in the rapidly growing crypto economy.

The biggest challenge for metaverse builders to overcome is the lack of platform interoperability. Currently, each platform exists in its own silo with no connection to the others. This fragmentation is a major hindrance to the metaverse’s growth.

## Conclusion

The metaverse era is still in its early stages, and it remains to be seen how it will develop over time. However, one thing is certain – as a concept, the metaverse is here to stay.
