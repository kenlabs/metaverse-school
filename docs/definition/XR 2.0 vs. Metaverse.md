# XR 2.0 vs. Metaverse

*What is the difference between the terms "XR" and metaverse?* *A commentary by Philipp Rauschnabel,* *[Reto Felix](https://www.linkedin.com/in/reto-felix-7b838a2/)* *and* *[Chris Hinsch](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chris-hinsch-01ab9a5/)*

There is a general consensus that immersive approaches to new realities are crucial for the metaverse. However, current discussions on social media, in the press, and even in academia frequently seem to suggest that XR technologies (such as AR and VR) are going to represent metaverse. We believe such a perspective is reductionist and potentially misleading. Rather, **we argue that XR applications are needed because they provide access to the metaverse**, but metaverse will be much more than just a collection of XR technologies.

## What exactly is the metaverse? Or is it a metaverse or several metaverses?

Metaverse might be conceptualized as “a fully immersed three-dimensional society-like environment that can integrate both physical and virtual worlds and can be accessed via XR (VR and AR) devices.” This might be simplified to “a monitor-free 3D interaction space that mirrors societies and can be accessed through XR.” However, metaverse does not currently exist and any definition for it remains speculative and futuristic. Furthermore, it remains unclear whether there will be a single open-source metaverse, several competing metaverses, or a mix of company-owned and open metaverse platforms.

Nevertheless, we identify three characteristics that constitute metaverse:

1. Metaverse is **experienced via immersive XR technologies**, such as AR and VR. Hence, 3D environments experienced on a computer or smartphone screen are not metaverse environments.
2. It must share some **similarities with physical societies** – such as socializing, presence of individuals (potentially through avatars), some sort of a legal structure (e.g., ownership and community rules), and transactions through alternative exchange forms such as cryptocurrencies.
3. It must be **decentralized**. It also follows that neither traditional Internet-based applications (including social media) and current VR worlds (such as Decentraland, Fortnite, Roblox, and Sandbox) are metaverse environments. The Table blow shows the core differences between the three concepts.

## Clarification: “Metaverse” is not XR 2.0

So, in short: Is the Metaverse the next generation of XR – such as XR 2.0? **NO!** **NO! NO!**

XR is the **gateway** to the metaverse. XR takes the role of a screen or a browser when accessing the “traditional” web (2.0). With better screens and better hardware, the Internet became better. But we would not consider a smartphone or a laptop computer “the Internet.” In the same vein, we should not consider XR technologies such as AR and VR “the metaverse.”

## What Managers need to know about the Metaverse

Many of us underestimated the effects of the expansion of the Internet, how social media would impact consumer behavior, and the explosion of crypto currency, and many might do the same with metaverse technology. In each of the examples above, savvy businesspeople seized the opportunities presented and have reaped the rewards of their vision. The metaverse concept will likely evolve in a similar way. Firms that understand its possibilities early will be positioned to leverage these digital environments and gain a competitive advantage in the future.

In the same way that social media has stolen consumer attention from print and other forms of legacy media, there is real potential that the metaverse concept will lead to the obsolescence of some social media platforms. Firms may be able to predict which markets might be attracted by metaverse applications and adjust their presence accordingly. More globally, understanding the new value propositions available in the metaverse may suggest future attrition in current media that would warrant divestment from specific platforms. This process begins with understanding the metaverse from the customer’s perspective. As the concept shapes and evolves, early adopter firms will be well positioned to reallocate their assets to the most engaging and profitable metaverse activities. Last but not least: Since XR is the gateway to the metaverse, we all need a profound understanding of how AR and VR can play a role in metaverse.

## **What is XR?**

For a better understanding, the following figure explains the differences between AR and VR (and their sub-forms). In short, AR is a combination of real and virtual elements, whereas users are totally closed-off from the physical environment in VR.
