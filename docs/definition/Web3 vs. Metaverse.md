## Web3 vs. Metaverse: What's the difference?

Web3 is a project built on blockchain and cryptocurrency, but there can be multiple metaverses. While the techs are intertwined, they have significant differences.

https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/Web3-vs-metaverse-Whats-the-difference



Buzzwords come and go, but some stick around. Two new terms you may have heard recently -- Web 3.0 and the metaverse --are frequently used interchangeably, but they are two different technologies.

Keep reading to learn what they are, what they aren't and how they differ.

### What is Web3?

[Web 3.0](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/Web-30), or Web3, has only recently been defined. Primarily, Web3 aims to be fully decentralized, putting content creation in the hands of creators and not platform owners.

While no one owns the internet, a few major companies exert considerable influence, and some critics say they have too much power. Web3 democratizes the internet and puts control back in the hands of users.

Web3 consists of five components:

1. **Semantic web.** The semantic web uses AI to understand what a user or customer may mean or intend. It's designed to provide a more accurate understanding of searches based on the actual meaning of the search words rather than keywords or numbers.
2. **AI.** The AI of Web3 is designed to better understand what someone is searching for to provide more relevant results.
3. **3D graphics and spatial web.** The use of virtual reality (VR) headsets and realistic graphics enables websites to become more realistic in nature.
4. **Blockchain and cryptocurrency.** Key to the decentralization of Web3 is the use of [blockchain](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/definition/blockchain) and [cryptocurrency](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/cryptocurrency), which eliminate middlemen and enable direct transactions between parties.
5. **Ubiquitous connectivity.** Web3 applications are characterized by constant connection due to broadband, [5G](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/5G), Wi-Fi and IoT.

In the fully realized spatial web, every element of every building in the physical world will be fully digitized. There will be virtual avatars for each human, and one will be able to roam virtual work or meeting places. This means every piece of information around the world will become spatial.

Now, try to visualize the spatial web. Imagine Google Earth in street view mode, but you can walk into the buildings rather than scroll by them. Spatial web consists of IoT wearables such as smart glasses, autonomous sensors and decentralized computing with blockchain.

There's also augmented reality (AR), which overlays information on an object, such as including trivia and instructions to conduct repairs.

### What is the metaverse?

Despite [Facebook changing its corporate name to Meta](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252508812/Facebook-rebrands-to-Meta-amid-continuing-controversies) in 2021, the metaverse isn't a Facebook effort, although Facebook is a participant in the metaverse.

The [metaverse](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/The-metaverse-explained-Everything-you-need-to-know) is a device- and vendor-independent collective virtual space created by the convergence of virtually enhanced physical and digital reality. It has its own independent virtual economy, enabled by digital currencies and nonfungible tokens (NFTs).

Education, medical, retail and virtual events can deliver a more immersive experience. They don't have to create their own infrastructure, but the metaverse will provide the framework. Virtual events can present more integrated offerings, while retail can offer a more immersive shopping experience.

In this regard, the metaverse is not unlike the spatial web of Web3. It's a virtual immersive experience focused on 3D graphics and the real-world image, rather than 2D graphics and text like the current web experience. Instead of clicking through a site's links, users walk through it virtually.

### Differences between Web3 and metaverse

The biggest difference between the two technologies is that people use Web3 to access the metaverse, much like how an automobile uses a road.

Web3 is about decentralized ownership and control and putting the web in the hands of its users and the community. The metaverse, on the other hand, is a shared digital reality that enables users to connect with each other, build economies and interact in real time -- and it doesn't care who owns it.

Web3 is also built on blockchain and cryptocurrencies, while the [metaverse uses technologies](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/tip/7-top-technologies-for-metaverse-development) such as AR/VR and digital currency. This is due to Web3 being decentralized and having no major corporate influence or control.

The two also differ in how they are used. Web3 is a new set of standards for how the internet should be used and governed. The metaverse is about gaming, social media, retail and other experiences.

### Common ground between Web3 and the metaverse

Web3 and the metaverse are inseparably linked to each other. The metaverse will continue to exist in surface and deep webs, even though Web3 is still frequently referred to as decentralized; however, the metaverse will remain centralized in terms of social media controlling platforms.

Both are built on advanced technologies that will evolve. The semantic web is common ground for both the metaverse and Web3. AI -- another key component of both technologies -- will be integral to building a sophisticated user interface.

In a technological sense, many of the advancements made with blockchain create common ground in both technologies. Every new blockchain concept is assessed as a potential module to integrate the Web3 engine that will power metaverse goods and services.

Web3 and the metaverse are in early stages. The final products will come [years from now](https://www.elon.edu/u/imagining/surveys/xiv-2022/future-of-metaverse-web3-2040/) and may be quite different, as technology doesn't always match the vision of its use.

## Web 3, a stack for an Open Metaverse

So why are we so convinced of this eventuality? Well, we believe there are several technology trends that are beginning to converge. This started with a trend we outlined back in 2016 which we termed The Convergence Thesis, which saw how amongst other things IoT, VR and AR, and AI would begin to interplay and reinforce one another into a new Internet because of blockchain technology and the shared data infrastructure and new open economic systems they enable. 

Whilst still nascent, this trend (keeping in mind it was written in the context of decades) has, as predicted, begun to play out and form the basis of our investment thesis as a venture capital firm and accelerator going through several iterations; the second being The Convergence Ecosystem in 2018 and then The Convergence Stack in 2019. 

>  Web 3 is a distinct and separate Web paradigm to today’s Web 2, based on centralised platform monopolies and highly regulated fiat financial systems, to one that is increasingly decentralised and based on user centricity and the sovereignty of their data and wealth. 

However, this is now more generally thought of as Web 3, a distinct and separate Web paradigm shift from today’s Web 2 (based on centralised platform monopolies and highly regulated fiat financial systems described earlier), to one that is increasingly decentralised and based on user centricity and the sovereignty of their data and wealth. In effect where ‘the user is the platform’. 

It is a paradigm ultimately based on blockchains and their atomic units of account becoming the means that value is ‘minted’ (created), stored, or transferred across other technologies as a form of wealth. But digital wealth that can be programmable and represent an increasingly complex range of assets from in-game items and virtual land to loan agreements or futures contracts. In aggregate representing an entirely new financial system often referred to as DeFi (Decentralised Finance). 

> In an evolutionary sense, by using the Open Metaverse OS the virtual world is pregnant with Web 3. 

You can think of this confluence of convergent technologies as a common operating system for an Open Metaverse that sits between the hardware, application software, and the user; and because of its open source characteristics, and anything that exists on-chain (on a blockchain) is transferable and its metadata visible, the DNA of the virtual worlds that build on top of it fully or even just partly is passed on or inherited. In an evolutionary sense, by using the Open Metaverse OS the virtual world is pregnant with Web 3.

### Web 3, a stack for an Open Metaverse

Web 3 consists of several principles, protocols and standards which could be said to form a stack that will inform and can and is being leveraged by the entrepreneurs and architects in The Metaverse. In combination these technologies can be seen as a highly composable Web3 Toolbox for The Open Metaverse, where they are one and the same thing.

>  We lay out the idea that there are a set of convergent technologies which allow for a common operating system for an **Open Metaverse** that sit between the hardware, application software and user. And because of it’s open source characteristics and on-chain transferability of assets through NFTs, makes digital assets and their metadata persistent and perpetual. In this sense **The** **Open Metaverse OS** makes the virtual worlds that build on it in part or as a whole pregnant with important Web 3 principles around user centricity, decentralisation and sovereignty which creates an unstoppable nature to its success.

### The Web 3 Toolbox

> We breakdown exactly how Web 3, its design principles, protocols and standards form a toolbox for the entrepreneurs & architects in the Metaverse which we describe as **The Web3 Toolbox** for The Open Metaverse, and propose they will become interchangeable terms, increasingly being understood to be one and the same thing.

![img](https://outlierventures.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Screenshot-2021-02-05-at-18.07.49.png)

The Web 3 Toolbox brings a number of core innovations and building blocks, located in the middle of the diagram: 

Internet Money: Bitcoin introduced a form of internet money and since then has served as a hedge to deflation, and increasingly for institutions as a treasury instrument, in fiat based systems due to loose monetary policies after a series of negative economic events and a gateway for many into a new virtual economy (at the time of writing estimated at 1 trillion USD in market capitalisation). 

Decentralised Finance (DeFi): Ethereum extended Internet Money through the introduction of smart contracts to allow for stablecoins, that is virtual currencies which unlike Bitcoin are designed to be a stable rather than a speculative asset. The generic programmability has allowed for an explosion in open, decentralised financial instruments often referred to as DeFi. These include borrowing and lending without the need for banks, as well as more sophisticated instruments such as options and decentralized exchanges, and some entirely novel structures, such as automated market makers. This has formed a proto-capital-market, at the time of writing estimated at $25 billion in total value locked. 

Sovereign Virtual Goods: Bitcoin introduced digital scarcity for a fungible asset (“internet money”), where each token is interchangeable for another. Similarly, digital scarcity for unique assets has been realised through NFTs (Non Fungible Tokens). Here, unlike with a currency, the underlying assets are not interchangeable but unique in some way. The innovation in this area has concentrated on Ethereum, and as the result of a handful of simple standards for NFTs and their metadata there has been an explosion of innovation initially in a creator economy context of; art, music, tickets, virtual land, collectibles and gaming items. 

Whilst not new, their mainstreaming began late 2020 and have proven to be a powerful mechanism for the world builders and content creators of the Open Metaverse. They act as a gateway through digital consumption and play that will suck in the masses of users primarily because any activity in the Open Metaverse can be gamified and rewarded with NFTs, which can in turn have value on the open market. Virtual goods are ultimately easier to sell than physical goods, and will have significant and increasing value. Core technologies and entities around NFTs include minting houses, which facilitate the initial creation of the goods, marketplaces, which similar to real-world auction houses, enable price discovery and trading. 

Digital to Physical Redemption: Beyond purely digital sovereign virtual assets, new specialised protocols like Boson Protocol solve the digital to physical redemption problem, by representing physical items as NFTs, which can be redeemed in the real world without the need for intermediaries. Enabling decentralized autonomous commerce across the Metaverse blurring the distinction between virtual and physical. 

Decentralized Governance: As a result of both the necessity for governing the growing landscape of decentralized technologies and networks and the ideals of its community, a class of tools and concepts for decentralized governance has emerged. The concept of a Distributed Autonomous Organization (DAO) enables individuals and entities to form groups, jointly own assets, make decisions, and participate in the economics of the DAO. Several mature building blocks for DAOs have emerged, including Aragon and DAOStack. They include and extend to tools like voting structures, and multi-signature wallets for joint custody of assets. On the level of protocols, mechanisms for staking and slashing have emerged to incentivise participants in these open networks to behave benevolently. The Open Metaverse can benefit from insights and tools from decentralized governance both for governing metaverse platforms and their components, and enabling economic participation in each, as well as for people to organize themselves within it, such as with gamer guilds or clans. 

Distributed Compute & Storage aka Cloud 2.0: The idea that The Cloud of distributed storage and compute could also be decentralised by specialised protocols like Filecoin or CUDOs, so not reliant on or giving any advantage to any one company for example Amazon, Google, or Microsoft, which control 66% of the market. It almost means people that invest in expensive hardware to access the Metaverse and increase performance can offset some of the cost by renting out capacity and in turn earning crypto-currencies and joining the virtual economy. It is also believed at a certain scale, and density in a given physical locale, it could increase the proximity of physical hardware to The Cloud at any given time as we unlock the bandwidth and compute of neighbouring connections, and therefore allow greater ‘edge computing’ for Metaverse ubiquity. 

Self Sovereign Identity & Verifiable Claims: For a truly Open Metaverse, it is crucially important for people to have security of an online identity with which they can protect and accumulate value. Sovereignty and, by consequence, self custody of what the user owns are core principles to Web 3. However, for what is called a true SSI (Self Sovereign Identity), we need dedicated protocols solely for the preservation of privacy of identity itself, versus being public and on-chain when identity and its data are treated as just another digital asset. Innovations in Self Sovereign Identity and Verifiable Claims specifically mean we can identify ourselves, transact, and prove things about ourselves (attest) without revealing the underlying or associated data. This is critical to avoid the role of a government or platform as the sole arbiters of our online identities, deplatforming or even state violence. And being applied to gaming and the Metaverse by teams such as Crucible. 

People, organizations, and machines access these capabilities directly through wallets and applications, and by delegation through automated agents, always following the principles of sovereignty and self custody: 

Self Custody - Wallets and Applications: The self custody of digital assets and wealth through user-controlled private keys and open source wallet software (free of any platform form of censorship and control) is foundational to crypto and as a consequence the Open Metaverse. This is sometimes referred to as sovereign wealth. The infrastructure was initially purely for the administration of crypto-currencies but is now being used for the management of other digital assets like data and NFTs (Non Fungible Tokens). 

Agent based Web: Computer programs with economic agency or autonomous agents that live and transact on blockchains to carry out increasingly complex automatic programs, such as AEAs (Autonomous Economic Agents) via Fetch.ai.



## Web3++: The Metaverse

TODO: https://adlrocha.medium.com/web3-the-metaverse-8c1f9f0efb40

What is all the fuss about this thing called the Metaverse. It must be something big if it made Facebook decide to change their name and branding to “Meta” making explicit the company’s new target in the near future. Rivers of ink have been flowing in the past few weeks in the [mainstream media with descriptions of](https://nypost.com/2021/10/21/what-is-the-metaverse-meaning-explained/) what the Metaverse is, its potential impact, and what it could mean for the Internet. Unfortunately, if you have exclusively read this mainstream publications **it may seem to you that the Metaverse is something that will simply add an additional dimension** to traditional social media to enable richer interactions with your friends; something that will take Fortnite to the next level by offering an immersive experience; or a new way to watch movies and buy online. But the truth is that **the Metaverse is all of this at the same time. To me, the Metaverse is a new front-end to the Internet.**

> “The Metaverse is this promised technology that would revolutionize not just the infrastructure layer of the digital world, but also much of the physical one, as well as all the services and platforms atop them, how they work, and what they sell.” — [Mathewball.vc](https://www.matthewball.vc/)

# What Is the Metaverse?

When posed with this question myself, I sometimes have a really hard time explaining what the Metaverse is. One of the reasons for this is that **the full vision for the Metaverse remains hard to define, seemingly fantastical, and decades away**. However, the pieces have started to feel very real ranging from VR to decentralized identities and DAOs. Something I would like for you to take out of this publication is that **the metaverse is not just what Facebook is presumably trying to build,** i.e. a 3D walled-garden you can enter to talk and play with your friends, but an open universe of digital worlds collaboratively created and offering you a great gamut of experiences.

Some of the key traits of the Metaverse everyone agrees on are:

- **It will be persistent.** The Metaverse will never be “reseted”, “paused”, or “ended”, it just continues indefinitely, as is the case for the Internet (or even blockchain networks ;) ). This is one of the reasons why it is not just an “immersive Fortnite”. Websites in the Internet are dynamic, and they may have changed the next time you visit them. The same will happen with the different worlds in the Metaverse, they are dynamic, as they may change and evolve in your absence.
- **It will be synchronous and live.** Pre-scheduled and self-contained events will happen in the Metaverse just as they do in “real life”, but the core will be a real-time common experience between users in the same part of the Metaverse.
- **It won’t be limited in the number of concurrent users that can “exist” at the same time** in the Metaverse, while giving each of them an individual sense of “presence”. This will open a set of potentially interesting technical challenges. How can we build an infrastructure whose quality of service is not impacted by the number of users? Or a more philosophical one, how would we model space, time or the laws of physics in this new universe?
- **It will be a fully functioning economy on top of the real economy.** Individuals and businesses will be able to create, own, invest, sell, and be rewarded for “work” done and “value” produced in the Metaverse and recognized by others. We may even get to the extent where you are “paid to play” in the Metaverse (if this is something other individuals value). And we can’t talk about a digital economy without mentioning the blockchain, cryptocurrencies and DAOs. I will leave this for the next few sections, but web3 technologies will happen to be core for the realization of the Metaverse.
- **Is being “inside the Metaverse” and “outside the Metaverse” two excluding experiences? Probably not.** Due to the current state of the technology you may be thinking of the Metaverse as this universe in VR, but the Metaverse will span both the physical and digital world through AR (Augmented Reality). Certain worlds of the Metaverse may be tied to physical locations and be only accessible when you are physically located somewhere. These are the kind of experiences any one will be able to build over the Metaverse. So the Metaverse is a platform where creators will be able to build (and own) these digital experiences, the same way the Internet became the platform for the distribution of 2D content. Have you ever dreamed of a world where everyone could fly? Well, this may be closer that you think.
- **It will offer unprecedented interoperability**: Digital assets are currently scattered in silos over the Internet. Even our data is siloed in the information systems of all the companies we interact with. Your favorite song may only be living in Spotify, while the collectible you unlocked in *League of Legends* is not there for you to use in *Fortnite.* Today, the digital world basically in the current Internet acts as if it were a mall where every store used its own currency. The Metaverse will aggregate all of these worlds and experiences under the same set of protocols, the same way IP gave the basic protocol layer for the interoperability of heterogeneous connected devices. The Metaverse is not just “a virtual space” or “virtual reality” as the ones we currently experience with the Oculus Rift. It is not a “game”, a “virtual theme park”, or a new “app store”. When you read the mainstream media you may feel like this is the Metaverse, but the truth is that we better look at the Matrix than read the media to get a real sense of how the Metaverse could look like. It **will be a platform where anyone will be able to build their own worlds and experiences (even ones that defies the laws of physics)** the same way the Internet has become this platform where anyone can build their own web applications to improve human capabilities.
- **It will be decentralized.** Anyone will be able to access it and interact with it independent of their location, Internet provider, or device they are running.
- Finally, it will be **populated by “content” and “experiences” created and operated by an incredible range of contributors** (from individuals to big organizations). And this is the key reason why what Facebook is building is probably not a Metaverse. Does anyone own the Web? Not really. Anyone is free to publish their own service or app. The same will happen with the Metaverse. Anyone will be free to create their own world, experience, content, or sub-economy. And here is where DAOs may have a key role to orchestrate the ownerships and interactions between members of the same world or community. **As you create your own world in the Metaverse, you’ll be able to deploy its own DAO to orchestrate the economy of the world, and govern its evolution.** No need for any centralized governance entity to ensure the long-term operation of the world, the DAO will implement the rules for members o the community to govern the world.

> If you want a simpler way to think about the Metaverse, you can imagine it as the Nightmare Before Christmas — you can walk into any experience or activity, and potentially address almost any of your needs, from a single starting point or world that’s also populated by everyone else you know. This is why hypertext is such a key example. But what’s important is to recognize the Metaverse isn’t a game, a piece of hardware, or an online experience. This is like saying is World of Warcraft, the iPhone, or Google is the Internet. They are digital worlds, devices, services, websites, etc. The Internet is a wide set of protocols, technology, tubes and languages, plus access devices and content and communication experiences atop them. Metaverse will be too. — [https://www.matthewball.vc](https://www.matthewball.vc/)

# The role of the Web3

In the above description you’ve come across some of the buzz words the web3 thrives on such as “decentralized”, “digital economy”, “decentralized autonomous organizations” or “interoperability”. **Another of the questions I started asking myself (and others) when thinking about the Metaverse was “what is the role of the Web3 in the Metaverse”.** As before, mainstream media didn’t have compelling answers, but fortunately, the right people were able to give me some light on the matter.

Building an infrastructure able to support the promises of the Metaverse can be technically challenging. Fortunately, some of the modules being built for the web3 can really lighten the challenge towards an open Metaverse:

- **A decentralized identity**. The metaverse is a continuum that never stops, and any individual is free to access. If we want this universe to be interoperable we can’t afford having to have a different identity according to the world you enter (as is currently the case for the Internet). **Your identity may have different traits dependent on the world, but your core identity shouldn’t change.** Even more, for digital assets to be interoperable throughout the whole Metaverse, they should be tight for your own identity, which means that this should be unique. There are already several proposals for a decentralized identity in the blockchain world, and there is even a standard being promoted by the [DIF](https://identity.foundation/) (Decentralized Identity Foundation) that is defining the “OSI model” with the stack of protocols required for a decentralized identity.
- **Decentralized storage:** For the Metaverse to be interoperable, open, and have no downtimes or be affected by the load in the system, it needs to rely on decentralized infrastructure. All the content, the worlds, and the digital assets from the Metaverse need to be hosted somewhere, and I don’t think AWS S3 buckets will be the chosen place for this. **Decentralized storage platforms like Filecoin or IPFS will definitely thrive once the Metaverse starts to become a reality, as the needs for storage close to the device will be deemed a requirement.**
- **Cryptocurrencies and NFTs as the core for the Metaverse’s digital economy.** At this point, we can’t think of a digital economy without cryptocurrencies and NFTs. These digital assets have already attracted an impressive amount of capital and paved the way for new financial markets with DeFi and NFTs. Imagine what they could achieve once they become the economy of a new digital universe.
- In the end, DAOs are a set of smart contracts to help orchestrate the decisions of individuals in the community. Thus, whenever a community formed in the Metaverse needs to handle property over a set of digital assets, the interaction of voting and governance, or the distribution of reward to members contributing to the world, they’ll be able to deploy a DAO to orchestrate these. Funding a state in the metaverse and rewarding the actions of individuals in this world through a DAO should be something straightforward in the Metaverse.

And there’s a common denominator in all the web3 modules mentioned above, a blockchain network orchestrating all of these interactions. **Every monetary transaction of the Metaverse, every ownership exchange, or even the minting of a new digital asset will potentially be operated and recorded in a blockchain.** The same will happen with identity related actions. Unfortunately, in their current state blockchains aren’t well-suited to support the Metaverse: they lack the performance (a thousand transactions per seconds doesn’t seem enough for the Metaverse); the economy of scale is not there yet to plummet transaction costs to an affordable level (only the rich would be able to afford the Metaverse if it was currently built over Ethereum); and we lack the interoperability (we shouldn’t expect a single blockchain network powering the Metaverse but many of them).

**This is why all of the advancements being made by projects in the blockchain space are not only important for the blockchain market, but it may also unlock impactful use cases at the Metaverse.** Projects like Metis exploring a L2 to minimize gas costs leveraging the trust of Ethereum could be a good entrypoint for the integration of the Metaverse with blockchain. Or the advancements around sharding and interoperability, enabling different worlds, assets and identities to be hosted in different blockchain networks but enabling a smooth interaction between them.

Improvements like the one I mentioned in this post to avoid the fragmentation of digital assets in different blockchain networks will end up being a utmost requirement in a blockchain network supporting the Metaverse.

# Metaverses, DAOs and DACs

In many of my publications, I’ve introduced the concept of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), and Decentralized Autonomous Corporations (DACs). They are both a key module in the future of Web 3.0. The Metaverse is as much a technical revolution as a social revolution, and DAOs, being the operating system of communities, will be key for the Metaverse. DAOs offer a technical layer to provide global and decentralized collaboration between individuals without having to trust third-parties or a small number of representatives (as is the case nowadays, see organization structures or representative democracies).

DAOs are a set of smart contracts to help orchestrate the decisions of individuals in the community. Thus, whenever a community formed in the Metaverse needs to handle property over a set of digital assets, or even the interaction of voting and governance. Funding a state in the metaverse and rewarding the actions of individuals in this world through a DAO should be something straightforward.

Unfortunately, DAOs may not be a perfect fit for the Metaverse, and may lack some important features to support the digital economy of a community in the Metaverse. This is why projects like Metis are exploring the evolution of DAOs, DACs. What are the improvements of DACs over DAOs and how do they fit the Metaverse? Apart from plain voting and the orchestration for governance, DACs are more scalable enabling horizontal scalability as the organization grows; DACs will be able to grow or be subdivided as the organization changes. DACs also have ways to implement access permissions and roles to different participants, enabling for richer interactions and use cases. They also include capabilities to implement HR, payrolls, corporate management, etc. in a decentralized manner, i.e. everything you need to start your own decentralized corporation. But what does this mean in the Metaverse?

- **Roles and reputation:** In “traditional” DAOs, every member has the same role, there is no way of setting special permissions or “powers” over different participants. DACs support this, allowing implement something like a DAC for a business in the Metaverse, where according to your position in the business, you have a different role, and thus you can influence in a different way how the business (and thus the DAC works). This links with another nice feature from DACs, an embedded reputation system that allows other DAC members to evaluate other members’ contributions within the ecosystem..
- **Scalability:** As mentioned above, organizations in the Metaverse should expect millions of transactions a day, and the system shouldn’t be affected by the number of parallel users, which means that interactions in the Metaverse and the DACs deployed in it should be able to scale seamlessly.
- Finally, no one knows how HR, payroll, or corporate governance will work for digital organizations in a digital universe where users can come and go, and you can’t trust a single “corporate governance entity” always available and connected to the system. DACs payroll, HR, and management will offer the capabilities to start designing what HR, payroll, and organizations look like in the Metaverse.

# What are the use cases?

At first, it was really hard for me to think about use cases of the Metaverse aside from games and virtual spaces. Then a good colleague of mine told me *“think of the Metaverse as adding an additional dimension to the Web”*. **Since then, when I want to think about the potential impact and use cases of the Metaverse, I try to add an additional dimension to the current use cases in the Web.** Try imagining how online shopping would look if you could do it in 3D and have an immersive experience. Or imagine how cool it would be if all over the Metaverse there were Quidditch fields for anyone to use. **You could meet with your friends to play Quidditch the same way you do every Saturday in the basketball court next to your house.** Even more, as you need a good pair of shoes to play basketball every weekend, you’ll need a brand new Nimbus 2000 broom for your Saturday Quidditch games. A broom that you’ll need to pay for, and which can be an actual NFT (only for you to own).

But the Metaverse is not only for fun. Think of the possibilities it opens for work. What happens if you add a third dimension to Google Drive, or Zoom? No more *“I wish I had a whiteboard to show you what I mean”*. You and your colleagues could be in the same space sharing a whiteboard and brainstorming as if you were in the same room.

If I had to summarize the Metaverse in a sentence it would be: **“the front-end to a 3D-version of the Web”**. Will we reach this? We’ll see, what it is clear is that many of the web3 modules required to build the promise of the Metaverse are here to stay.





## **Web3 & Metaverse: Where do they fit each other?**

Many of us might be confused about how Metaverse and [Web 3.0](https://www.queppelin.com/what-is-web-3/) are related. The answer to this is simple. 

Metaverse is a platform where content is created and consumed. Anyone can create content for anyone. On the other hand, Web3 is an iteration or version of the web that will infuse decentralization into the Metaverse. Hence, when creators create content in the Metaverse, they can monetize it at their convenience.

Further, Web 3 allows users of the Metaverse to own their data and have full control over its utilization.

There are three major components of Web 3 (the next version of web) –

**Blockchain**

It is a distributed ledger system that offers immutable protection to the data stored in it. It is highly reliable, robust, and near-impossible to tamper with. With blockchain, users can store their data with complete protection.

**Digital assets**

These assets are issued on a blockchain. They are used to represent value, portability, ownership, and permanence. This facilitates the exchange of value between Metaverse dwellers without intermediation.

**Smart contracts**

They are self-executing protocols that contain conditional programming code. Once the pre-defined conditions are met, they get executed automatically. This introduces automation to all the processes across the board.
