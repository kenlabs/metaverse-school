# Recommended tools

Like previous technology shifts such as social media, mobile, and cloud, the metaverse could become a game changer. If you’re researching opportunities in this niche, a close look at metaverse development tools is a great way to start.

The metaverse refers to a 3D virtual universe that mimics aspects of the physical world and allows users to communicate and interact in the digital space.

Vendors, including tech giants Meta and Microsoft are already building solutions that can replicate user lives in digital worlds. According to McKinsey, corporations and venture capitalists invested [$120 billion](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/business functions/marketing and sales/our insights/value creation in the metaverse/Value-creation-in-the-metaverse.pdf) in the metaverse between January and May 2022. This will contribute to the development of new [metaverse use cases](https://pixelplex.io/blog/top-metaverse-use-cases/) and technologies.

If you plan to be one of the early adopters of metaverse technology, we recommend a deep dive into our list of metaverse development tools and frameworks.
