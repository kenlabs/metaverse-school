# Matthew Ball’s Metaverse Primer

Matthew Ball is tracking the emergence of the Metaverse around eight core categories, which can be thought of as a stack (click each header for a dedicated essay).

## [Framework for the Metaverse](https://www.matthewball.vc/all/forwardtothemetaverseprimer)

How much of the Metaverse is already here? When will it arrive? What does it need? And how will it grow? A Foreword to ‘THE METAVERSE PRIMER’

## [Hardware and the Metaverse](https://www.matthewball.vc/all/hardwaremetaverse)

[![Hardware and the Metaverse](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5d8e9007bc3d0e18a4c49673/1624968802212-WXMDBWBEZ1JM8J7ZKGKL/VR.jpg?format=500w)](https://www.matthewball.vc/all/hardwaremetaverse)

The role of hardware in the Metaverse. Part II of ‘THE METAVERSE PRIMER’

The sale and support of physical technologies and devices used to access, interact with, or develop the Metaverse. This includes, but is not limited to, consumer-facing hardware (such as VR headsets, mobile phones, and haptic gloves) as well as enterprise hardware (such as those used to operate or create virtual or AR-based environments, e.g. industrial cameras, projection and tracking systems, and scanning sensors). This category does not include compute-specific hardware, such as GPU chips and servers, as well as networking-specific hardware, such as fiber optic cabling or wireless chipsets.

## [Networking and the Metaverse](https://www.matthewball.vc/all/networkingmetaverse)

[![Networking and the Metaverse](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5d8e9007bc3d0e18a4c49673/1624970150794-V3RL822UFEFX9RM996KR/via3oep3mX5EERi6AGsHkQ.jpg?format=500w)](https://www.matthewball.vc/all/networkingmetaverse)

The role of networking in the Metaverse. Part III of ‘THE METAVERSE PRIMER’

The provisioning of persistent, real-time connections, high bandwidth, and decentralized data transmission by backbone providers, the networks, exchange centers, and services that route amongst them, as well as those managing ‘last mile’ data to consumers.

## [Compute and the Metaverse](https://www.matthewball.vc/all/computemetaverse)

[![Compute and the Metaverse](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5d8e9007bc3d0e18a4c49673/1624976497288-LAK414WPQARKQ7NSYB8C/jelanisetiho.jpg?format=500w)](https://www.matthewball.vc/all/computemetaverse)

The role of compute in the Metaverse. Part IV of ‘THE METAVERSE PRIMER’

The enablement and supply of computing power to support the Metaverse, supporting such diverse and demanding functions as physics calculation, rendering, data reconciliation and synchronization, artificial intelligence, projection, motion capture and translation.

## [Virtual Platforms and the Metaverse](https://www.matthewball.vc/all/virtualplatformsmetaverse)

[![Virtual Platforms and the Metaverse](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5d8e9007bc3d0e18a4c49673/1624978912625-H9ZTB9XXQPRZXFS20YNV/Niantic%2BReal%2BWorld%2BPlatform%2BVR%2BAR%2BGlobal%2BSummit%2BVRARA%2B.jpg?format=500w)](https://www.matthewball.vc/all/virtualplatformsmetaverse)

The role of virtual platforms in the Metaverse. Part V of ‘THE METAVERSE PRIMER’

The development and operation of immersive digital and often three-dimensional simulations, environments, and worlds wherein users and businesses can explore, create, socialize, and participate in a wide variety of experiences (e.g. race a car, paint a painting, attend a class, listen to music), and engage in economic activity. These businesses are differentiated from traditional online experiences and multiplayer video games by the existence of a large ecosystem of developers and content creators which generate the majority of content on and/or collect the majority of revenues built on top of the underlying platform.

## [Interchange Tools + Standards and the Metaverse](https://www.matthewball.vc/all/interchangemetaverse)

[![Interchange Tools + Standards and the Metaverse](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5d8e9007bc3d0e18a4c49673/1624986962285-5O5HCVUJ1V7EZWT3DV46/CP.png?format=500w)](https://www.matthewball.vc/all/interchangemetaverse)

The role of interchange tools + standards in the Metaverse. Part VI of ‘THE METAVERSE PRIMER’

The tools, protocols, formats, services, and engines which serve as actual or de facto standards for interoperability, and enable the creation, operation and ongoing improvements to the Metaverse. These standards support activities such as rendering, physics, and AI, as well as asset formats and their import/export from experience to experience, forward compatibility management and updating, tooling, and authoring activities, and information management.

## [Payments, Payment Rails, and Blockchains, and the Metaverse](https://www.matthewball.vc/all/metaversepayments)

[![Payments, Payment Rails, and Blockchains, and the Metaverse](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5d8e9007bc3d0e18a4c49673/1626047196332-AHBR1ZAKWUZIREAF3E8B/super-mario-bros-gameplay.png?format=500w)](https://www.matthewball.vc/all/metaversepayments)

The role of payments, payment rails, and blockchains in the Metaverse. Part VII of ‘THE METAVERSE PRIMER’

The support of digital payment processes, platforms, and operations, which includes fiat on-ramps (a form of digital currency exchange) to pure-play digital currencies and financial services, including cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin and ether, and other blockchain technologies.

## [Content, Services, and Asset Businesses in the Metaverse](https://www.matthewball.vc/all/csametaverse)

[![Content, Services, and Asset Businesses in the Metaverse](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5d8e9007bc3d0e18a4c49673/1626037268301-IIJL4RFB9GRM81JLS1I1/Come-as-You-Are-RSVP_Gucci-Garden-on-Roblox.jpg?format=500w)](https://www.matthewball.vc/all/csametaverse)

The role of content, services, and asset businesses in the Metaverse. Part VIII of ‘THE METAVERSE PRIMER’

The design/creation, sale, re-sale, storage, secure protection and financial management of digital assets, such as virtual goods and currencies, as connected to user data and identity. This contains all business and services “built on top of” and/or which “service” the Metaverse, and which are not vertically integrated into a virtual platform by the platform owner, including content which is built specifically for the Metaverse, independent of virtual platforms.

## [Evolving User + Business Behaviors and the Metaverse](https://www.matthewball.vc/all/userbehaviorsmetaverse)

[![Evolving User + Business Behaviors and the Metaverse](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5d8e9007bc3d0e18a4c49673/1626045216458-DAZEHJ2TJKLOSKS8D842/article-2049117-0E5E4E9700000578-261_1024x615_large.jpg?format=500w)](https://www.matthewball.vc/all/userbehaviorsmetaverse)

The role of evolving user + business behaviors in the Metaverse. Part IX of ‘THE METAVERSE PRIMER’

Observable changes in consumer and business behaviors (including spend and investment, time and attention, decision-making and capability) which are either directly associated with the Metaverse, or otherwise enable it or reflect its principles and philosophy. These behaviors almost always seem like ‘trends’ (or, more pejoratively, ‘fads’) when they initially appear, but later show enduring global social significance.

(You’ll note ‘crypto’ or ‘blockchain technologies’ are not a category. Rather, they span and/or drive several categories, most notably compute, interchange tools and standards, and payments — potentially others as well.)
