# OV Open Metaverse OS

## Building in the Metaverse

Were you to be using this toolbox to build an entirely new instance within the Metaverse (such as a virtual world), or looking to evolve an existing Web 2 platform, you would be presented with a set of design decisions and trade-offs at several levels of your stack between open / shared or closed / gated and proprietary. You might reasonably elect for an open solution at one level and closed at another, either permanently or temporarily based both on the immediate needs of your business and its stakeholders (like shareholders), users, or a philosophical principle. In the end, there will always be a tension to be imperfectly resolved. 

A way to approach this is to look at the anatomy of any given instance of the Metaverse as a platform at its various levels of the stack as we have outlined below.

#### User persona:
the identity and properties of end users, including their name, avatar, ownership of assets, and reputation.

#### End-user hardware and software:

the hardware devices and software through which end users experience the world, including VR / AR headsets, PCs, gaming consoles, and client software.
#### In-world assets:
the assets that exist within the virtual world.

#### Physical (virtual):
the space of which the world is composed, such as sections and parcels. The objects that can exist within it, such as buildings, furniture, vehicles, wearables, collectibles, and avatars as a special case.

#### Economics:
economic elements of the world including in-world currency, financial instruments, and marketplaces.

#### Content:
content that can be introduced into the world, including media such as images, audio and video,and structured data assets.

#### World primitives and rules:
how does the world work? The model for user identity, ownership, and reputation. The mechanics and physics of the world. Can users fly? Run? How fast? Can objects be stacked on top of each other? Attached to buildings? Programmability and agents - in what ways can elements of the world be automated - and can autonomous digital agents interact with the world?

#### Software backend:
the backend components that make the world work.

#### Hardware infrastructure:
the hardware on which the backend components of the world run. Servers in data center, cloud services, networking.

#### Bridges:
ways in which the world can connect to external systems and environments. 

#### To digital worlds:
using shared layers for assets and economics, external programmability via APIs, teleporting to different virtual environments.

#### To the physical world:
including AR based activities such as in Pokemon Go, and digital elements that have a physical counterpart, such as physical redemption for digital assets.

Each of these elements can exist in any virtual world, in some form or another, open or closed.Many centralized virtual worlds have in-game currencies, some have forms of in-game financial instruments, for example mortgages in Animal Crossing.

### The Open Metaverse OS

So how ready is Web 3, and consequently an Open Metaverse OS, for prime time? Well, on the one hand the Web 3 ecosystem is thriving with several nascent technologies that can enable many aspects of an Open Metaverse, and could and is being deployed in virtual worlds right now, albeit in an incremental fashion. But on the other it’s still significantly behind on several measures such as performance and cost when compared to Web 2, which has had decades to mature and where the benefits of economies of scale have been achieved by platform monopolys. 

Equally, Web 3 technology has instead optimised primarily for high degrees of decentralisation and transaction security rather than and sometimes at the expense of enabling smooth, real-time interactions, and its applications for more 2D web based experiences on desktops and mobiles. As a consequence, user experience in Web 3 has to date been poor and required a high degree of technical literacy due to both the radically different security model of self custody and the nascency of the industry; with frictionless user experience of Web 3 technologies within gaming engines even further away. This narrative gradually changes as we observe the world of Web3 and crypto technologies being deployed within gaming and VR environments at at growing rate. This provides further proof of a generational shift away from Web 2 platforms. 

Therefore, the Open Metaverse OS is best understood as an evolving collection of highly composable technologies that will increasingly, but selectively, be used to make aspects of an Open Metaverse possible as it seeks to serve a greater global population across several use cases and environments. It is also meant as an invitation and inspiration for teams to build those components that don’t exist yet, or aren’t ready for the needs and sheer scale of ambition we have for The Open Metaverse. 

> Is the Open Metaverse OS ready for prime time? With our view being that Web 3 technology has been optimised primarily for high degrees of decentralisation and transaction security rather than and sometimes at the expense of enabling smooth, real-time interactions. And its applications for more 2D web based experiences on desktops and mobiles. As a consequence user experience in Web 3 to date has to date been poor but that this is changing as increasingly the world of Web 3 and crypto is it’s self converging with new environments like gaming and VR there is a generational shift away from Web 2 platforms.

As it stands, the Open Metaverse OS is concentrated on the critical lower layers of the stack, including non negotiable features such as user-sovereign identity and assets, in world economics and bridges into and out of its economy, and between each themselves leaving the intricacies of gaming engines, 3D modelling toolchains, and rendering stacks to the primarily centralized world. However, over time we expect the Open Metaverse OS to eat further downwards to decentralise those aspects as well.

## An Oppenness Framework

This way of thinking about the Open Metaverse OS also allows a framework through which to assess the openness or, otherwise, design choices and trade-offs made by a given instance of the Metaverse including; is the code open source, are the assets portabile, is the data platform proprietary or user controlled, who can create value, and the degree of UGC versus platform made and how can it be monetized.

It is important to stress, however, it is unlikely openness is absolute and its choices binary, but rather on a spectrum. And even within those virtual worlds and platforms we could classify as the most ‘open,’ there will be significant nuance, often driven by technical limitations both of being an early adopter as well as dependencies on underlying protocols like Ethereum which require workarounds for improved usability comprising what happens on-chain, impacting ‘openness.’ 

For example, it seems Decentraland is the only Metaverse project thta has a fully open source approach but still takes a more restrictive approach to avatars and wearables. E.g. like Cryptovoxels, it doesn’t store avatar files on-chain, nor is their system available to outside avatar models and wearable minting is curated.
