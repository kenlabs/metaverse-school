# The Metaverse Value-Chain

## What is Metaverse?

In the recent past, the phrase “**Metaverse**” has gained significant global attention. Although the term was first introduced by author Neal Stephenson in his 1992 sci-fi novel ‘Snow Crash’, it has recently turned into a popular buzzword in the world of technology, business, and finance.

*“The metaverse is a 3D version of the Internet and computing at large. When these two technologies (internet and computing) first emerged, all interactions were primarily text-based (emails, messages, usernames, email addresses). Then they slowly became more media-based (photos, videos, livestreams). The next elevation of user interface and user experience is into 3D. Secondly, if we think of [a] mobile [phone] as placing a computer in our pocket and the internet being available at all times, think of the metaverse as always being within a computer and inside the internet.”* – **Mathew Ball, Venture Capitalist, and Angel Investor**.

A **metaverse** is a network of **3D virtual worlds** centered on social connection. It is characterized as a simulated digital environment that incorporates augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), Internet of Things (IoT), 5G, artificial intelligence (AI), and blockchain, as well as social media principles, to build places for rich user interaction that resemble the real world. It is a self-contained virtual economy powered by digital currencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

Metaverse is intended to provide permanent, decentralized, collaborative, and interoperable opportunities and business models that will allow companies to extend their digital operations.

*“Metaverse will allow people to replicate or enhance their physical activities. This could happen by transporting or extending physical activities to a virtual world or by transforming the physical one. Although the goal of a Metaverse is to combine many of these activities, there are currently many individual Metaverses with limited functionality.”* – **Marty Resnick, VP Analyst at Gartner**.

**Jon Radoff** is a business owner, novelist, and game creator, who has written extensively on the subject of “Building the Metaverse.” His conceptual framework is made up of seven layers that explain the metaverse market’s value chain.

**Infrastructure** is the **foundation layer**, which means that without a proper framework, no subsequent advances are feasible. As a result, **technological** processes are situated at the center of the layers of the metaverse.

**Experience, discovery, creator economy, spatial computing, decentralization**, and **human interface** comprises the other stages.

## Layer 1: Experience

This is the layer on which most businesses and individuals are now focused. Users interact in digitally-driven settings via content such as gaming, shopping, NFTs, e-sports, and theatre. The metaverse is more than just a 3D representation of reality. It will be the ultimate virtualization of physical space, products, and distance. The limits that are physically imposed will be lifted when physical space dematerializes.

As a result, the metaverse will give everyone a plethora of experiences that they are currently unable to enjoy. 

Games will develop to include more live entertainment-inspired events, such as music concerts and immersive theatre, which have already appeared in some applications. Social entertainment will supplement e-sports and internet communities.

According to **Jon Radoff**, *“More and more, consumers are also becoming content creators. Not just in the outdated sense of “user-generated content” but in the form of events and social interactions.”*

## Layer 2: Discovery

The discovery layer is concerned with the push and pulls that introduces individuals to new experiences. “Pull” depicts an incoming system in which users actively seek information and experiences, while “push” is more outbound and incorporates procedures that notify users about what experiences await them in the metaverse. The discovery layer is, in reality, the most profitable for enterprises. Some ways in which inbound and outbound discoveries take place include:

* **Inbound:** Community-driven content, Search engines, Real-time presence, App stores, and Earned media

* **Outbound:** Display advertising, Emails and social media, and Notifications

**Community-driven** content is a considerably more cost-effective way of discovering new things than other types of marketing. As content becomes simpler to swap, trade, and share across more metaverse situations, it becomes a marketing asset. As a tool of discovery, content marketplaces will substitute application marketplaces.

## Layer 3: Creator Economy

According to **Jon Radoff**, *“Creators gain tools, templates, and marketplaces of content that reorient development from a bottoms-up, code-centered process to a top-down, creatively centered process.”* The creator economy refers to the technology that creators utilize to produce metaverse experiences, such as design tools and applications, as well as workflow platforms.

Content makers will be crucial in shaping this new environment. They have had remarkable success on social media platforms and will continue to be a significant driver of growth in the metaverse’s virtual reality. They will design their metaverse areas where their viewers may connect, hang out, and interact with them.

Creators will be able to transform the metaverse into a revenue-generating opportunity through selling commercial products, NFTs, and IRL products, displaying, and selling NFT collections.

## Layer 4: Spatial Computing

Spatial computing is a real/virtual combination that blurs the line between the actual and ideal worlds. Spatial computing has grown into a broad category of technology that allows to explore and alter 3D locations, as well as enrich the physical world with additional information and experience. This layer’s primary features include 3D engines such as Unity and Unreal.

Geospatial mapping also aids in mapping and analyzing the inner and outside worlds. Integration of data from devices (Internet of Things) and biometrics from humans is already widely employed in the health and fitness industries. Finally, speech and gesture recognition are integrated in spatial computing software.

## Layer 5: Decentralization

The metaverse, in an ideal world, would be decentralized, open, and diffused – governed by a single entity and belonging to no one and everyone at the same time. Experimentation and growth increase when choices are maximized when systems are interoperable and built inside competitive marketplaces. Furthermore, creators get control over their own data and goods. 

Decentralization includes the blockchain, smart contracts, open-source platforms, and, eventually, the prospect of self-sovereign digital identity. Distributed computing and microservices are increasingly enabling a scalable environment for developers to utilize online capabilities.

## Layer 6: Human Interface

Human interface is a critical feature of the metaverse’s hardware layer. Additionally, biosensors and neural connections between brains and computers are already being tested. The majority of the technologies involve wearables such as VR headsets and smart glasses, but it also contains neural network and haptics technology. This layer also includes haptics, which allows information to be sent by touch even when no objects are present. Using haptics, one may operate electronic gadgets in mid-air without touching buttons or a screen.

## Layer 7: Infrastructure

The seventh layer ‘infrastructure’ contains the technology that makes everything listed above a reality. 5G and 6G networks, Wi-Fi, cloud architecture, artificial intelligence, AR/VR/MR, blockchain, and graphics processing units are examples of the underlying technology and network components that enable the metaverse (GPUs). 5G networks will vastly boost capacity while simultaneously decreasing competition and latency.
