# Storage - The Cornerstone of the Metaverse Ecosystem

The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted many people to shift their social, entertainment, and even dining, shopping,work and other activities from the real world to online execution. The boundary between the real world and the virtual world is gradually blurred, and the era of metaverse is quietly coming. The maturity of blockchain technology has provided the metaverse with core technologies such as computing, storage and network, while the maturity of DeFi economic model has brought new innovative and open value carriers like cryptocurrency and NFT to the metaverse.

In the wave of metaverse, many enterprises and developers are actively embracing NFT and releasing unique digital collection assets. The essence of digital assets and NFT is data, and data storage as well as security is one of the key elements for the landing of the metaverse ecosystem.

## The Core of the Digital Age - Data

From Web 1.0 to Web 3.0, the volume of data production has exploded from passive data reading to feverish content creation. When the real world pans out into the virtual world of the metaverse, the volume of data will once again increase exponentially. At the same time, whether virtual identity or NFT digital assets, its essence is data. In the metaverse, data has become the core carrier of value, so it can be seen that the storage and security of data is of great significance to the development of the metaverse.

In the iteration and integration of software and algorithms, the storage industry has gradually evolved from traditional disk storage to cloud storage by breaking through the physical limitations of hardware, but it still cannot meet the needs of the metaverse ecosystem. The drawbacks brought by the centralized model will bring enormous potential problems to the ecosystem of the metaverse, which is why the decentralized storage represented by IPFS is recognized as a necessary underlying technology for Web 3.0 and the metaverse.

IPFS provides a high-throughput, content-addressable block storage model with content-related hyperlinks for the purpose of decentralized, fast, efficient, reliable, and secure content storage. IPFS also pioneered the creation of an incentive layer, Filecoin, which allows any individual to use free hard disk space and bandwidth to provide data storage and retrieval services on the open market, and monetizes hard disk capacity to create a positive incentive system with infinite scalability.

The distributed architecture based on blockchain technology will store data slices scattered on multiple independent network nodes, advocating privacy protection, data redundancy backup, etc. Meanwhile, Filecoin adopts PoRep (proof of replication) and Post (proof of time and space) to ensure miners' real storage of files and prevent attacks of sybil, generation, outsourcing and other false storage data, providing full security while ensuring data authenticity.

The metaverse accommodates a huge data system and digital assets, and the data must be ensured to be stored and invoked permanently and securely in order to truly carry the core value of the digital era. In the metaverse, IPFS & Filecoin serve as the underlying foundation to provide a permanent, secure place for all values to be stored.

Although the ecosystem of IPFS & Filecoin is still in its infancy, it will take some time to truly embrace the ecosystem of the metaverse.The market has a large number of preachers and pioneers actively promoting the development and growth of the ecosystem, so that more people can easily participate in the construction of the digital era and promote the integrated development of the entity economy and the digital economy. With the efforts of these pioneers, we may be able to enter the true world of metaverse soon.

## IPFS

*In the age of the internet, data is everything. But where does all this data get stored? Where do our YouTube videos, Instagram photos, Wikipedia pages, and the quintillion bytes of data uploaded daily on the internet get stored?*

### The current model of storing and accessing data

A majority of the data uploaded on the internet goes into huge physical facilities called cloud servers that have tens of thousands of storage and computation devices stacked over one another. Most of these servers, and thus the internet, is controlled by tech giants like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and IBM. 

Anyone can pay to remotely access the storage or computation power of these servers. And that’s what all Web2 platforms from our favorite content streaming platforms to social media use to store data and load web images. Here’s a step-by-step overview of how it works:

\1. When you upload a file on a Web2 platform, it is stored on a centralized cloud server.

\2. This storage location of that file is assigned a respective URL or Uniform Resource Locator.

\3. Whenever you have to access that file, you need to enter the URL that points to the file’s location on the server.

\4. The server then looks up the file and loads it on your browser.

This process of accessing files on the internet is called location-based addressing.

But there are major problems associated with this method of storing and accessing internet data on central servers.

### The dark side of central servers

Now that you know that most of the world’s data is stored on central servers controlled by a few major corporations, ask yourself if it is really a great idea? Let alone everything, ask yourself if it is fine that all your data, your pictures, videos, and documents stored on Google Drive, website, or iCloud could be wiped if a central entity failed to keep it online? 

It sure isn’t.

As recently as October 4, 2021, [Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp](https://www.ledger.com/academy/blockchain/decentralized-social-media-why-and-how) went down globally for hours at length. All of a sudden, you could no longer access your messages and posts on Facebook and Instagram or download images you received on WhatsApp. That was because the “location” where all the data was stored was not accessible, or, put simply, the server was down.

And downtimes are common in the [Web2](https://www.ledger.com/academy/web-3-from-information-to-value) space. Central servers often face issues and become inaccessible, resulting in the URLs failing to access websites and platforms and loading it on our browsers.

Furthermore, hackers can target a central point and conduct an attack on these servers to steal data. Or, governments can easily censor internet platforms and information, like what we already see throughout the world. That is all possible because everyone knows where exactly the data is stored and where they need to target.

Good for us that times are changing and systems are becoming trustless, meaning that we no more need to trust a third party. And leading the transition to a “trustless” model is the InterPlanetary File System, a.k.a. IPFS.

### What is IPFS?

In the words of the founders of IPFS, InterPlanetary File System “is a distributed system for storing and accessing files, websites, applications, and data.” That is, it is a system that does everything that centralized clouds do but without a centralized storage system. 

So, where does the data go then? The answer is in the word “distributed.”

Similar to how[ blockchains](https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-is-the-blockchain-trilemma) rely on [nodes](https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-is-a-node-and-why-should-i-operate-one) to contribute their computing power to verify data, IPFS has hundreds of thousands of nodes — individual computer systems connected to IPFS — that offer their storage bandwidth to store the files and content uploaded to the network. 

That means, if Wikipedia utilized IPFS to store its content, it would be stored across a distributed network instead of a central server. And as long as at least one of the nodes storing a particular page is online, users will be able to access that page by entering the link to it. The same can be done for other platforms, websites, and apps.

Due to the decentralized network of nodes, it is almost impossible to guess which node stores what data on IPFS. This removes central points of failures and minimizes the chances of censorship and hacks.

Now that you have a basic idea of what IPFS is, let’s dive deeper and understand how all of what we said falls in place and functions as one integral system.

![IPFS Stack](https://takahser.github.io/tldr/ipfs-stack.png)

### How does IPFS work?

Instead of utilizing location-based addressing, where users point to the location of a file on a central server, IPFS uses content-based addressing where users request a file using a unique ID of the file. 

Here’s a step-by-step overview of how uploading and accessing files and data on IPFS works:

\1. When you upload a file on the IPFS network, it is divided into smaller parts and encrypted with cryptographic hashing.

\2. To identify the file, the network assigns it a unique identifier called a hash or content identifier (CID).

\3. Whenever you want to access this file, you can use this CID and ask the network of nodes who has the file corresponding to it. Note this difference from Web2 — you’re not pointing to a location, like you do on a central server/Web2, instead, you’re asking for the file directly.

\4. Any node that has the file on their system then sends it to you and it loads on your browser.

\5. As soon as you receive the file, your computer caches a copy of the file and you become another provider of that file until the time you decide to clear your cache. If you want to, you can also choose to store that copy of the content and become a permanent provider for as long as you want.

The fact that you’re accessing a file by pointing at its content and not its location is why this approach is called content-based addressing.

And every time new data is added to a file, it creates a new file with a new CID while retaining the previous version of the file on IPFS. This means the entire history of a file can be immutably stored across IPFS. 

Does it mean you have to remember complex hashes of every new version to access the files? Not really. The files can be linked to readable domain names on the Domain Name System just like we have today for regular websites, pages, and platforms.

But again, why should we be using this approach instead of just sticking to what we already have?

### Why use IPFS?

As our lives become more digitized, we need to find a more reliable place to store our data. We can no more put a few central entities in control of a majority of the world’s data. And that’s what makes IPFS the need of the hour.

The benefits of replacing centralized servers with IPFS are quite apparent. Your access to data relies not on one central point but on several computer systems supporting the network. IPFS offers us a storage system that is not only immutable due to its decentralized nature but also makes all the data accessible 24×7 without fail. 

And if you’ve ever been unable to access data due to censorship, then that too ends with the usage of the distributed storage system that is IPFS. Further, IPFS takes away the unprecedented control that tech behemoths have today over the internet and distributes it among the users of the network. Above all, it creates a more democratic internet that is more user-centric and resilient to manipulation.

### Advancing toward the future of web and data storage

Around 10 to 15 years ago, data was not such a big concern. If you recall, all that you may have been using are an email service, an eCommerce store, and, maybe, a social media platform. Today, things have changed. We live half our lives on the internet, and you can reflect upon the internet’s importance based on how you panic when you cannot access the online world when the “server is down.”

And IPFS is that solution that makes sure you enjoy access to your favorite platforms, your birthday photos from the past, your emails, your chats, and everything else online at all times. It brings you and every individual the promise of securing humanity’s critical data through the power of [decentralization](https://www.ledger.com/academy/crypto/why-decentralization-matters).

## Filecoin

*[Filecoin](https://www.ledger.com/coin/price/filecoin) is the blockchain project that incentivizes regular people to rent out their digital* *storage space – solving the issue of scarcity, and addressing power imbalance between individuals and global server behemoths, in one fell swoop. Pretty cool, right?*

Even though we can’t make our VR selves go to work instead of us (yet), our lives are more digital than we’d like to admit. I mean, it’s difficult to imagine life without your daily morning Instagram scroll, Zoom calls, or relaxing with your favorite songs on Spotify, right?

These digital lifestyles generate data — lots of it.

In fact, our current storage systems are absolutely drowning in data, with [79 zettabytes](https://www.domo.com/blog/what-data-never-sleeps-9-0-proves-about-the-pandemic/) consumed on the Internet in 2021. That’s 21 zeroes after 79 — roughly about 79 billion laptops, with a 1 TB storage capacity each. 

What’s more: this number is expected to double within 5 years. Now, this begs the question…

#### Where is all this data being stored?

Even though these numbers paint a picture of an internet too big to fathom, the reality it’s just a handful of companies providing all of the storage, Google, Amazon, Facebook, and IBM, to name a few. There are a number of reasons why this is not ideal, and it all revolves around our tricky old friend, centralization.

#### Server Outages Mean Unreliable Storage

For starters, let’s talk outages. Outages are common in Web2. If you were to Google “social media outages and why they happen”, you’ll be greeted with a variety of reasons ranging from technical changes to hacker attacks. Even simple errors can cause an outage: for example, [one well-intentioned command from an engineer](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/oct/05/what-caused-facebook-whatsapp-instagram-outage) recently disconnected Facebook from its 3.5 billion users for over 6 hours. Well, that’s what happens when so much data is controlled by a single authority — small mistakes can cause major disruptions to millions of users and businesses.

#### Centralized Structures Can be Censored

If outages weren’t enough, you also have into the issue of censorship. If a website talks about something controversial that people with big wallets don’t want others to talk about, it can be promptly “dealt” with by the provider, in other words – switched off. Since everyone knows where the data for the site is hosted, it’s easy for governments AND hackers to target such websites.

#### Digital Storage is a Commodity

And finally, we have the basic issue of supply and demand. With more and more things going digital, internet storage is in limited supply, meaning the price of data storage is likely to inflate. Think that won’t happen for a long time? [Google Cloud’s proposed ](https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/14/inflation-is-real-google-cloud-raises-its-storage-prices/)price increase says otherwise.

On the flip side, what if the companies controlling your data decide it’s no longer economically viable to keep their service online? What will happen to your data then? Worse — what if the data you stored is shared without your consent with third parties? 

In short, whether you’re looking at data storage through the prism of cost, control, privacy or simple reliability, the centralized nature of our internet servers has big implications for users like you and me. And that’s why new blockchain-based network Filecoin is so important for offering us an alternative.

### What is Filecoin?

In order to understand what the Filecoin blockchain has to offer, we need to take a quick step back and look at its underlying storage system, IPFS.

Filecoin’s blockchain builds on the base technology of its parent project [IPFS](https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-is-ipfs) (which we have covered extensively at Ledger Academy). To summarize, IPFS is a decentralized peer-to-peer file storage system where individuals can run their own nodes and store files anonymously. 

The only problem?

This platform has the potential to benefit millions of us who are seeking decentralized digital storage space – but until now, there was no way of incentivizing individual nodes within IPFS to let other people use their space. There was simply no mechanism to connect buyers and sellers.

### Filecoin: Decentralized Digital Storage Marketplace

That’s exactly why Filecoin exists. Its decentralized marketplace enables individuals to monetize their storage space by renting it out in a trustless manner. All data is encrypted and it’s faster than you’d think. Essentially, IPFS provides the foundation, and Filecoin unleashes its full potential.

Let’s take a closer look at how Filecoin provides the infrastructure for a thriving ecosystem of storage providers and clients. 

### The Tech Behind Filecoin

The FIL blockchain itself doesn’t store files — it acts as a ledger (…like all blockchains) of all transactions made through its native token, FIL which can be received and sent through our [Filecoin wallet](https://www.ledger.com/filecoin). Along with the transaction, the block also includes the agreement between the miners who store the data and the clients whose data is being stored. 

Although this might look pretty straightforward, how do you guarantee that the miners are storing an accurate version of the requested file? How do you also guarantee that bad actors in the network don’t tamper with your data?

Filecoin solves these issues with two [consensus mechanisms](https://www.ledger.com/academy/consensus-protocols-how-are-blockchains-secure): Proof of Replication and Proof of Space Time.

In Proof of Replication, the miner must prove that they have stored client data correctly. This proof is a cryptographic hash denoting the file. The miner ID and this proof are written to the blockchain, confirming the encrypted data storage.

Now, to guarantee that the miners are still holding data at a given time, PoSt is used. PoSt randomly picks miners from the network and demands to see proof of storage at random intervals. If any node cannot produce it, the concept of penalties comes in.

Whenever miners commit space to the network, they must add collateral in FIL tokens to incentivize good behavior. If they do not abide by the storage rules and are unlucky enough to be picked by the PoSt algorithm, they can bid their tokens goodbye. 

### How does Filecoin Work? A Closer Look at its Marketplace

In Filecoin’s ecosystem, everyone shares an open market for data storage. Here’s a rundown of how Filecoin’s marketplace works:

**Choosing a provider:** Suppose you want to store 1 TB of your vacation photos on Filecoin. The first step is to select a Filecoin-based decentralized application such as ChainSafe Files or Estuary. These applications provide a quick and easy interface for you to drag and drop your files, choose a provider, and set the terms of the agreement.

**Negotiating the contract:** Once you’ve chosen a provider based on your specific needs, you can then proceed to negotiate the price in FIL tokens for storing your data. After an agreement is reached, it’s time to pay the provider to store your tokens. Post that, the transaction and the agreement contract are written to the FIL blockchain.

**Retrieving the data:** Retrieval is quick and easy if you want to reminisce down the memory lane. Once you send in the request, the network assigns retrieval miners tasked with retrieving your data as quickly as possible. Naturally, there’s a FIL cost attached to this service. If you’re not in a hurry, the retrieval will cost you next to nothing. However, if you need it within seconds, you’ll need to shell out a considerable sum in FIL for them to prioritize your transaction.

The FIL token fuels the entire Filecoin network. Clients pay in FIL to store their files on the network, while nodes who have committed space to the network are rewarded in FIL. Along with its crucial function as a utility token for the Filecoin marketplace, FIL also acts as a [governance token ](https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-is-a-governance-token-and-why-does-it-matter)that you can use to vote on the project’s key decisions.

### Why should you care about Filecoin?

The main benefit of Filecoin is that storage will finally be something that we can trust. Blockchain’s transparency and the free-for-all market it enables are not something you’d ever get from centralized entities. And that’s exactly what Filecoin capitalizes on. Thus, the endgame for Protocol labs is to enable one of the main pillars [of a fast, decentralized internet ](https://www.ledger.com/academy/school-of-block/episode-9-financial-freedom-what-is-web-3)— data storage — with IPFS and Filecoin.

With Filecoin, you wouldn’t have to worry about losing your data if an organization fails or jacks up its prices to sky-high levels. You can also earn rewards if you commit your own unused space to the network.

### Decentralizing the world’s storage

Decentralizing the world’s storage has a direct impact on all of us. Currently, providers like Google Drive have a lot of the world’s data stored on their servers. Any change in their terms causes a ripple effect on the livelihood of other businesses and the economy as a whole. 

However, if you participate in decentralized storage networks, you can potentially save a lot of money. And with incentives for participating in the system and complete control of your data, what’s not to like?

As the internet and data grow, [decentralization will no longer be an option – it’ll be a necessity](https://www.ledger.com/academy/crypto/why-decentralization-matters#:~:text=Decentralization tends to promote transparency,in a completely public ledger). And judging by the growth of projects like Filecoin, we’re not far from that reality.

### Evaluating the Decentralisation of Filecoin

Web3 is progressively decentralising many Internet services with the introduction of the blockchain, from social networks to online trading. Filecoin is a Web3 storage marketplace implemented on top of the Interplanetary File System that aims at decentralising storage by rewarding users who pledge storage to the system. Clients form deals with storage miners, who store deals on the Filecoin blockchain for transparency and auditability. Storage miners can also obtain extra rewards when they mine a block. In this paper, we show that although Filecoin aims at complete decentralisation, the rewarding system acts as the opposite. We download a dataset composed of approximately 47M messages and expose that most of the blocks are created by the same few storage miners, who are also the ones that pledge more storage. A detailed analysis of the identity of the miners shows that they belong to cloud companies, that have a lot of extra storage resources. The effect observed is due to the fact that storage miners are able to commit all the extra storage to the system, even when there are no deals in them. We also see that this effect is further intensified by recent updates to Filecoin, which let storage miners update committed storage to deal-containing storage effortlessly.
