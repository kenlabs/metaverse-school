# Computation in Metaverse

Metaverse will be the 3D replica of your physical life where you can do everything you do in this physical world. To make this possible, high computation in metaverse is required to render immersive 3D worlds and run data hungry Artificial Intelligence (AI) application.

## What is computation?

In general terms, if you solve any mathematical calculation like addition, subtraction, etc, it is said as computation. Your brain does the computation. But, your brain does computation in solving logical problems, overcoming some difficult situations, thinking of solutions to a problem, deciding to do something, etc. All these tasks are computations.

![What is COMPUTATION](https://i0.wp.com/metaversetroop.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/What-is-COMPUTATION-.webp?resize=765%2C428&ssl=1)

Similar to our brain, a computer also does computation to perform some mathematical and logical functions. All the work to be done on the computer is called a problem. To solve this problems algorithms are designed efficiently to solve the problems.

Everything in the metaverse right from data collection to rendering data and videos to provide an immersive experience to users is considered computation. The computation is performed by CPUs and GPUs present in the devices involved in the metaverse.

## Need for computation in metaverse

Beside a reliable and low latency communication system in metaverse, it will require other services. The resource intensive services provided in the metaverse will require costly computation in metaverse.

Generally, there are 3 services that require high computation needs in metaverse. They are listed below and explained in detail.

- Physics Calculation
- Rendering
- Artificial Intelligence (AI)

### Physics calculation in metaverse

The 3D world in the metaverse  works similar to our physical world. Real world physics is involved in all the objects in the 3D world of metaverse to provide users experience realism. These require realistic physics computations.

For example, when you drop or create a virtual asset in the metaverse like your avatar, its behavior should be governed by the laws of physics as in the real world. 


The virtual assets with physics properties are usually built using Unity and Unreal engine.These engine ensures that these virtual assets in metaverse accelerate and respond to gravity, collisions and other physical forces.

These physics calculations put much pressure on the CPU and GPU of the machines running the metaverse.So, it needs teraFLOPS of graphics horsepower for computation in metaverse.

### Rendering in metaverse

Rendering is a process of converting raw data of images and videos into 3D images and video files. In any metaverse, all the images, videos and 3D models requires a rendering process to display the objects for the users to see. So, the rendering process has a huge cost for computation of metaverse.

A rendering engine or software does all the process of rendering as shown in the figure below. Huge amount of computation power is required for rendering. 

![COMPUTATION IN METAVERSE RENDERING](https://i0.wp.com/metaversetroop.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/COMPUTATION-IN-METAVERSE-RENDERING.webp?resize=712%2C278&ssl=1)

 For example, games like Fortnite require teraFLOPS of graphics horsepower. As the user base and demand for metaverse projects like Fortnite, The Sandbox, etc is increasing day by day, imagine how much computing power will be required.

### Artificial intelligence (ai) in metaverse

Artificial Intelligence is a must for any metaverse. AI allows the users to experience highly immersive metaverse experiences. AI synergizes with AR/VR applications to provide services in metaverse like hand gestures to copy and paste files between computers.

AI techniques also are essential for the AR/VR rendering process as discussed in the previous section. You can take the example of **[DeepFovea ](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/deepfovea-using-deep-learning-for-foveated-reconstruction-in-ar-vr/)**which is used to reconstruct images. It can reduce the number of pixels while constructing high image resolution. Use of AI requires high computation in metaverse. But it also reduces some computation needs and resources enhancing rendering efficiency.



## Computation layers for metaverse

Most of the applications you use today are online applications and used mostly by mobile devices. Since mobile devices have limited computing power and storage space, these applications are hosted in cloud servers.

Cloud servers use its computing power to process, render and deliver the task provided by the low end mobile device of the users. In addition to cloud computing there are 2 additional layers – fog computing layer and edge computing layer to minimize the burden of cloud computing layer.

As you might know, metaverse requires much more computational power, storage space, bandwidth , etc to provide the immersiveness to the user. Most of the users will use metaverse in their hand held devices like mobile phones, tablets, etc.

So, to provide the usual experience of metaverse for all the devices, computing layers for metaverse is essential. A single layer infrastructure cannot handle huge computation needs in the metaverse. Rendering of images and videos is a core component of metaverse. So, 3 layers of computing in the metaverse is proposed as shown in the figure below. The layers are listed below.

- Cloud Computing
- Fog Computing
- Edge Computing

![3 Layers of Computing in Metaverse](https://i0.wp.com/metaversetroop.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/3-Layers-of-Computation-in-Metaverse.webp?resize=896%2C672&ssl=1)

### Cloud computing layer for metaverse

The best example of application of cloud computing is Google Drive, [iCloud](https://www.icloud.com/), [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/), etc. Here the cloud stores your files and you can do a host of tasks with these files through your mobile and computer.

In cloud computing your physical devices need to transfer the data on to the cloud. But the computation power is provided by the cloud servers to do the tasks. This is where edge computing and fog computing come to play.

The metaverse is resource and computing hungry. It needs a huge amount of computation power, storage space and fast and advanced communication technology. Moreover, with the increase of user base cloud computing is must and essential for any metaverse application. Cloud gaming is one the use case of cloud computing for metaverse as discussed below.

#### Cloud gaming in metaverse

Game is one of the most sought out and prevalent use of metaverse beside other use cases of metaverse. All the metaverse games are hosted in the cloud and that is why it is called cloud gaming. It uses cloud layer of computing in the metaverse.

Cloud gaming integrates cloud computing to enable high quality immersive games in metaverse. In the case of mobile devices, mobile cloud computing is used. It provides computing services to either mobile mobiles or mobile embedded systems. One of the best examples of cloud gaming is Microsoft Flight Simulator which is explained briefly in the next section below.

In mobile cloud computing, the cloud providers install the servers in private infrastructure and the services of the cloud are provided to the client via virtual machines. But the most economical approach is to combine cloud and in-house resources for providing services in metaverse.

Users’ devices like mobile, PCs, tablets, etc. are usually unable to store and process games of metaverse. Therefore, most of the data and processing power is done in the cloud and the gameplay content is streamed on users devices. The user’s device only stores a core amount of data with minimal computation.

#### Microsoft flight simulator

[Microsoft Flight Simulator](https://www.flightsimulator.com/) provides the users with realistic flying experience. There are 2 trillion rendered trees and plants, 1.5 billion buildings and almost all roads and infrastructure and airports of international cities. You can say that it has a digital twin of airports, roads, building, etc.

But for providing this immersive experience Microsoft Flight Simulator comes with a cost. It requires 2.5 petabytes of data to run. Generally, any user’s PC, Laptop, etc is unable to store and process such a tremendous amount of data. So, it has combined cloud computing architecture and in-house resources to run the simulations.

The data and processing power is done in the cloud layer of computing in the metaverse. and the simulation content like birds eye view of cities is streamed on users device. The user’s device only stores a core amount of data with computations offloaded whenever necessary

### Fog computing for metaverse

Data is transferred from edge devices to the cloud computing layer. If unnecessary data is transferred anytime, it will burden the cloud computing layer. Here fog computing layers come to play to lessen the burden of cloud layer.

Metaverse has a lot of connected edge devices like AR/VR headset, IoT devices, sensors, etc. A lot of communication, interaction, transfer of data takes place every seconds/microseconds from the edge layer devices The data sent to the metaverse may be sensitive, essential, relevant, etc. or might not be.

If all of the data is sent from the edge layer, then it will put a lot of burden on the cloud layer. Moreover, mobile cloud computing for metaverse can no longer support the high demands for real time applications like AR/VR. These devices need near to zero latency.

To reduce transmission delay or latency, fog layer of computing in the metaverse. is installed between the cloud computing layer for metaverse and edge computing layer for metaverse. It deploys many fog nodes in this layer.

For example, fog computing nodes may be installed on speeding vehicles, trains or in low network area, etc. In this situation, users might be unable to access the metaverse as they cannot maintain a stable connection with the cloud. 

To reduce latency, Fog nodes can connect the edge devices or users through wireless connection such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth and provide storage service and computation in metaverse. Moreover, privacy in metaverse is mitigated by keeping users personal information within the fog node and sending encrypted data to the cloud.

So, from the above discussion it is obvious that fog computing is a an important layers of computing in the metaverse.

### Edge computing for metaverse

Edge computing is computing that is done at or near or edge of the source of the data being generated. Ege computing basically connects edge devices such input devices, sensors, IoT devices, etc. It is the most essential layer among the 3 layers of computing in the metaverse.

Data generated by these edge devices are sent to the cloud computing layer generally through fog layer. Traffic of data from these edge devices can be massive and inefficient. Additional irrelevant data is sent to the cloud that is scraped away by the fog computing layer as discussed in the previous section.

Metaverse requires as much computational capacity as possible. The users accessing metaverse through their mobile phones requires latency to be as low as possible . Low latency is required in metaverse to real-time, advanced, computation-intense capabilities like speech recognition and AR/VR.

Edge computing is one of the solutions to overcome the needs for metaverse. It provides

- Low latency
- High efficiency
- Security

to sustain the metaverse. So, it is an important layer of computation in the metaverse.

Edge devices of metaverse like AR/VR headset, Haptic suits, sensors, etc transmits data to the cloud computing layer. The data passes through the fog computing layer before reaching the cloud layer. 

Most of the computing is done at this layer and fog layer to reduce the burden of cloud layer. This layer has the lowest latency among all the 3 layers of computing in the metaverse.
