# NFTs and Their Role in The Metaverse

Many people will recognize NFTs merely as images of digital artworks or collectibles that they can sell for huge prices. However, this digital art in present times has brought up various new opportunities with NFTs and Metaverse. NFTs represent the ownership of digital assets and physical assets in the blockchain and it is a huge portion of the metaverse. The Metaverse and NFTs are related to digital assets and how they are lent value. Metaverse will enable people to show digital forms of art and assets, and NFTs will enable them to put a value on that content with proof of ownership.NFTs are the bridge to the metaverse and enable identity, community, and social experiences across the metaverse. 

## What are NFTs and the Metaverse?

### Non - fungible token

NFTs or [non-fungible tokens](https://www.blockchainx.tech/non-fungible-token-development) are a new category of digital assets, which are unique, inseparable, and inflexible. They represent ownership of digital and physical assets on the blockchain. From digital artwork to the gaming industry, NFTs are creating a vast impact everywhere. 

But do you know any real-world use cases for this new token type?

#### Digital Collectibles

A digital collectible refers to any digital item that users can own and trade with other users via a blockchain network or platform. They could also be traded for fiat money or other cryptocurrencies through exchanges. For example, a movie studio might create digital collectibles for their movies and sell them as merchandise in exchange for money or cryptocurrency.

#### Immutability Tokens

NFTs create unique digital assets that are immutable and cannot be altered once created. This makes them ideal for recording property deeds and other documents that need to be permanently stored in the blockchain. Immutability tokens allow users to prove that they were the original creator or owner of something.

#### Game Rewards

Games often have their own internal economies parallel to the real world where players can buy virtual items and sell them on an open market or trade them with other players within the game itself.

#### Digital Identity

Blockchain technology can provide a secure and immutable way to store your personal information and documents in a decentralized database. This can help prevent hackers from stealing personal information from centralized databases through data breaches or phishing attacks since all sensitive data remains encrypted on the blockchain.

#### Entertainment

For years, the entertainment industry has been gradually shifting to accommodate the digital age. NFTs can also be used to act as tickets for events or access passes for venues such as sports stadiums or concert halls.

### Metaverse

Metaverse is a digital environment moving on the blockchain, where technologies such as VR and AR can function as visual component providers. The decentralized nature of blockchain provides unlimited business opportunities and possibilities for social interaction. Metaverse provides a highly versatile, scalable, and interoperable digital environment. Most importantly, the Metaverse mixes inventive technologies with models of interchange between participants from individual and enterprise opinions. 

The metaverse will bring together people, brands, social networks, businesses, applications, and services all within a single, real-time 3D environment. But do you know any real-world use cases for this new token type?

#### Digital Advertising

Digital ads are becoming more common in cities across the world, with many companies using them to promote their products and services. The Metaverse offers another way for companies to advertise their products or services within the real-world environment, which makes it more immersive and engaging than traditional digital ads.

#### Events and Conferences

This can be done through the use of virtual reality (VR) or augmented reality (AR). It allows people to virtually attend events as if they were there in person.

#### Virtual Tourism

The Metaverse can be used to create virtual tours of destinations around the world. This is a great opportunity for those who cannot travel due to various reasons, whether they cannot afford the financial costs, or the busyness of work does not permit them to do so, or they otherwise cannot leave their country. These tourists can experience the immersive experience exploring monuments, museums, landmarks, etc. virtually.

#### Education and Learning

The metaverse provides an excellent opportunity for teachers to create interactive lessons that help students learn more effectively and retail information for longer. However, this is still an emerging trend in e-learning, and one can already anticipate challenges in terms of student engagement. Yet, there is a lot to explore in this field for learners and teachers.

#### Real Estate

Real estate companies have begun using virtual reality to give consumers an immersive look at homes they may be interested in buying or renting. It also helps sellers by giving them an edge over their competition when it comes to attracting buyers because they are able to provide a more realistic experience than their competitors who may be using traditional methods. It also saves clients the time and distance to inspect listings that may be different from what photos capture.

## NFTs – a record of ownership

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are one of the fastest-growing areas of the metaverse, appealing to people’s curiosity, creative talent, and investment desire for digital art collections. NFTs are digital assets that represent physical things such as art, music, in-game goods, and videos. They are often purchased and traded online using cryptocurrency and are typically encoded with the same underlying software as most cryptocurrencies.

Before NFTs and blockchain technology, there was no guaranteed method to verify ownership of anything online, much alone a digital asset. Now, there is. NFTs are used to prove ownership accurately and transparently, especially in a virtual world; as such, NFTs will continue to play a crucial part in the metaverse economy.

Furthermore, NFTs may serve as metaverse building blocks for several applications, including the “TradArt” universe. This sector is hampered by intermediaries and corporations that do not adequately reward creators for their efforts. NFTs play a part in virtual real estate. In addition to serving as the legal agreement of ownership, NFTs constitute the land and buildings of the metaverse. To purchase, trade, or build land in the metaverse, it is necessary to mint an NFT that symbolises the property.

## NFTs contribution to the metaverse

In the metaverse, NFTs are almost identical now. [NFT technology](https://www.blockchainx.tech/non-fungible-token-development) permits individuals to have entire ownership of digital assets such as audio, images, video, and even real estate within the metaverse. NFT allows individuals to sell or buy items and transfer them to the Metaverse or over the Internet. 

The price paid by some digital artwork for the idea of NFT giving ownership of digital goods has already been approved by the majority of the population.

### Transparent economy

The truth that [blockchain](https://www.blockchainx.tech/) renders transparency and immutability ascertains the significance of NFT in the metaverse. These characteristics play an important role in the metaverse’s fairness and transparency. The scarcity of NFTs and their on-chain value would subsequently be assumed by the fundamental rule of supply and demand. As an effect, you won’t discover any paths to increase the worth of anything artificially. You can see how the metaverse and NFTs cooperate to create a fair and transparent economy. 

### An Extension of community, social and identity experiences

The influence of NFT metaverse initiatives would also impact metaverse user identification, social, and community experiences. By developing NFT assets, users can show their consent for a certain project or express their thoughts on the virtual and real worlds. As a result, groups of like-minded NFT owners might appear to exchange ideas and collaborate on creativity. 

Users might operate NFT avatars to get virtual membership to several real-world and metaverse experiences. Blending the metaverse with NFTs may enhance users’ social and community experiences. NFT avatars’ capacity is further ascertained by their use in the metaverse for startup launches and content evolution. 

### Virtual real estate

The virtual world implies lots of virtual space and real estate. You can use [NFTs](https://www.blockchainx.tech/non-fungible-token-development) for increasing the full ownership of the virtual space in the metaverse. With the help of blockchain, users can easily prove ownership of assets along with the development of the virtual real estate. 

Selling virtual land for profit is one of the vital use cases for such NFT metaverse enterprises. In addition to creating other structures such as online shops or events, you can rent land for passive income. 

## How to Use NFT In the Metaverse?

NFT is a game changer. It’s proven to drive engagement, retention and revenue for companies using it. Here, we’ll highlight specific ways that it features in the metaverse.

### Virtual Marketplace

The virtual marketplace is perfect for how to use NFT in the metaverse because it allows users to easily buy and sell digital assets. Users can also create exclusive limited-edition items that only exist within a virtual world or game — these would be ideal for collectors looking to acquire rare items.

### Art gallery

The metaverse can be used as an art gallery where people can buy digital art using NFTs. This is a clever use case for digital art because it allows artists to get paid directly by their fans without going through a go-between company. In a virtual art gallery, NFTs can be used to represent pieces of art that can then be sold or rented out.

### Play-to-Earn Gaming

One of the most popular uses for NFTs is in video games – especially those that require some kind of leveling up or achievement system. Players can earn tokens by playing certain parts of the game or completing tasks within it. These tokens can then be used to unlock various levels or access new content within the game.

### Social Interactions/Events

In the Metaverse, you can use NFTs as an avatar that represents you when interacting with other users. You could also use NFTs as tickets or badges for events, such as conferences or concerts organized by your company.

### Virtual Real Estate

NFTs are ideal for creating virtual real estate because they can be used as collectibles that people want to own. Virtual real estate can range from a small plot in a virtual city where users can build homes or businesses, to entire planets where users can build civilizations from scratch, all within the metaverse.

## What Are the Benefits of Using NFTs in the Metaverse?

There are many benefits to using NFTs in the metaverse when compared to traditional methods of asset ownership. Here are some of the most notable.

### More Secure

One of the biggest advantages of using NFTs in the metaverse is that it allows for a much more secure way to own and trade virtual assets. Since all transactions are recorded on the blockchain, there is no risk of fraud or theft. This is a big contrast to traditional methods of owning and trading virtual assets, which are often susceptible to scams and hacks.

### Creates Scarcity

Another advantage of using NFT is that it can help to create scarcity. This is important for virtual worlds, as it can help to give items a sense of value. NFTs can also be used to represent unique items, such as one-of-a-kind pieces of digital art. This can help to make the virtual world feel more real and exciting for users.

### Monetizes Assets

Finally, NFTs provide a way to monetize assets in the metaverse. This is important for developers and creators, as it can help to fund the creation of new content. NFTs can also be used to create income streams for virtual world businesses. This can help to make the metaverse a more sustainable place for creators and businesses.

## The Challenges With Using NFTs in the Metaverse

There are a few challenges that need to be considered when using NFTs in the metaverse. One of the most important is how to represent ownership of assets. This is particularly important for virtual worlds, as it can be difficult to determine who owns what. Another challenge is how to ensure that NFTs are used in a way that doesn’t create inflation. Also, it’s important to consider how NFTs will be traded and sold. For example, will there be a central exchange or will trade happen directly between users?

One familiar real life problem that metaverse users will face, particularly when it comes to artworks, is the difficulty in distinguishing between NFT sellers offering genuine, authentic and original art in contrast to pieces that have simply been copied by a scammer looking to make a quick buck. Highly respected glitch artist, Rosa Menkman, publicly complained about such a problem, after she found five of her pieces being advertised and sold as NFTs on the OpenSea platform without her authorisation. While NFT marketplace platforms can de-list NFTs of plagiarised works, this will be of little consolation to buyers who spend their cryptocurrency thinking they’ve purchased a genuine digital artwork as an NFT, only to find it’s the equivalent of a forgery. The lesson here for buyers is to do thorough due diligence on NFT sellers and not rely on the platform to carry out this investigative work for them. OpenSea’s terms and conditions make this clear, stating that: “… you bear responsibility for verifying the legitimacy, authenticity, and legality of NFTs that you purchase from third-party sellers” *(Section 5 – OpenSea Terms of Service, December 31, 2021).*

Although recent case law in the English courts has gone some way towards recognising NFTs as property under English law (*Osbourne v Persons Unknown and Ozone [2022] EWHC 1021 (Comm) (10 March 2022)),* metaverse users who suffer a loss when dealing in NFTs are likely to find themselves faced with another problem, identifying the person to sue! Unlike an auction of artwork at Sotheby’s or Christies, where the purchaser or seller (an individual or organisation) can be identified relatively easily, the anonymity provided by digital wallets in blockchain transactions can make it extremely difficult for aggrieved parties to a transaction to initiate a claim.

Although blockchain technology in theory creates a clear record of each digital wallet which has held a particular NFT, tracing digital wallets (a string of numbers and letters) to their owners can be a tricky feat. Not only does anonymity jeopardise buyers obtaining remedies against fraudulent sellers of NFTs, but it also throws up an obstacle for artists or brands seeking to enforce NFT licence terms against subsequent downstream purchasers of their NFTs. If a buyer breaches a typical term of the NFT licence by, for example, using the NFT commercially or reproducing and re-selling the NFT of the artwork or digital item, then there is little that licensor can do to enforce those terms if they do not have a real person to take action against, and do not know the jurisdiction in which to commence proceedings.

The ability to connect a real life person with a virtual self and a digital wallet will be increasingly important within the metaverse as commerce and trade in this space (including via NFTs) begins to thrive. As our digital and real lives become increasingly intertwined, metaverse stakeholders will need to help join the dots between real individuals and their virtual selves, to ensure that people remain responsible and accountable for what their avatars may do, sell or own in this new virtual reality.

These are all important challenges that need to be considered when using NFTs in the metaverse. However, they are not insurmountable, and there are already several projects working on solutions.
