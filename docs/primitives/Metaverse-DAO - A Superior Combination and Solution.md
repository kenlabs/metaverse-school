# Metaverse-DAO - A Superior Combination and Solution

Web 3.0 has already started making inroads in our daily lives and new technological innovations will be over the horizon soon. Blockchain is one such component of Web 3.0 that is contributing significantly to transforming enterprises and society. The metaverse is one such phenomenon that has been catching all eyeballs. In this blog, we will discuss how metaverse and DAO have the potential to empower the technology sphere as a combined force. We will go through how [**decentralized autonomous organizations in the metaverse**](https://www.antiersolutions.com/dao-development-company/) work, how Metaverse developments are enabling various new transformational avenues for enterprises, and dive deeper into some popular names in the field of DAOs in the metaverse.

Before getting into the details, let’s take a quick dive into DAOs.

## What is Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)

An online community that is decentralized and autonomously governed by smart contracts is known as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). A DAO’s laws and ethics are incorporated on the blockchain, unlike entities in the conventional corporate world, making them impervious to any manipulation or intrusion.

The majority of enterprises and businesses in the conventional world today have hierarchical structures, frequently with a tiny group of people implying control. DAOs are distinct in a way since they are managed by members and governed by the entire community. Because there is no boss or dominant authority in a DAO, it can enable interpersonal collaboration in a way that has never been achievable before, which is one of the reasons why many crypto enthusiasts are optimistic about the potential of DAOs.

The efforts that DAO members make to the enterprise are frequently recognized and honored. The clear and transparent smart contract code on the blockchain determines incentives. A DAO’s rules are constantly accessible to everyone. A majority of the DAO’s members must agree on any change to the rules. Voting is recorded on-chain, making it public as well.

Members of a DAO can submit proposals for contributions, and in most cases, they are compensated with the governance token of the DAO. The contributor is reimbursed from the DAO if members approve the idea.

DAOs fulfill duties that cannot be completed by software only, even though smart contracts provide a method to systematize and conduct business.

Members can use their tokens to cast votes in DAOs, where important decisions are made through the majority of votes. This implies that any changes or advancements within the DAO must first be approved by a majority of the organization’s members. DAOs rely on their members to vote on modifications, unlike blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which attempt to establish unanimity for every activity through nodes.

## Prominent Advantages of DAO

1. **Controlled by a computer program**
   Conventional organizations are led by distinct individuals, whereas DAOs are run by computer code. Blockchain-based governance makes that no one person is in charge of the community. As a result, choices are made more quickly and transparently. You can get help from an expert blockchain development business to create a DAO and add smart contracts to it for quicker execution.
2. **Deployment of smart contracts**
   The digital contracts that are a part of the blockchain architecture are how DAOs achieve consensus. Automated smart contracts have irreversible, secured data that is permanent. The algorithms eliminate the need for human instruction and incorporate complex data. Nevertheless, making decisions with a DAO is quicker and more practical. DAO allows you to vote on issues without having to see the voters in person. You can design smart contracts for DAO with the assistance of a blockchain programmer skilled in ethereum contract creation.
3. **Strong confidence and complete openness**
   The nicest thing about DAO creation is that it provides organizations with instant confidence and openness so they can concentrate on pursuing their common goals. Since the rules of collaboration are written into a clear, secured, and open-source blockchain registry, members don’t need to be acquainted with one another. No member can change the procedures in the absence of a majority vote since the blockchain ledger cannot be tampered with. Therefore, a DAO entity’s sole function is to further the group’s overall interests.
4. **Community-owned System**
   DAOs have a uniform organizational structure with no central governance, in contrast to typical organizations. Each token owner has one vote per token within the organization. One of the code rules at the DAO development stage specifies that a person’s voting power is based on the volume of tokens they possess. No participant is granted any exclusive advantages or benefits. So, before writing the code, a seasoned Blockchain development company is aware of this necessity.

People initially opt to give money utilizing ethereum contract creation after meeting at various social networking sites. The organization decides to carry out its task as a single unit after raising funds.

In November 2021, [**Snapshot Labs**](https://www.theblock.co/linked/124915/snapshot-labs-raises-4-million-in-seed-funding-to-build-dao-governance-solutions) raised USD 4 Million to scale up its DAO development team and capabilities. It has a research arm of its own which stated that in the last year, the total number of [**decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO)**](https://cointelegraph.com/decentralized-automated-organizations-daos-guide-for-beginners/what-is-decentralized-autonomous-organization-and-how-does-a-dao-work), the number of governance proposals put forward, and the number of votes cast have all seen astounding 8-times growth over the past 12 months. This shows the increasing confidence and application of DAOs in the corporate space. Now let’s move towards the world of Metaverse.

## What is Metaverse?

It’s time we explore the phenomenon called Metaverse.

The words “meta” and “universe” are combined to form the term “metaverse.” It is primarily used to refer to Web 3.0, a frequently celebrated forthcoming generation of the internet. V virtually connected ecosystems that give users access to simulated AR/VR-based experiences are anticipated to rise in prominence and adoption as the internet evolves.

The term “metaverse” describes both present-day and prospective interconnected digital platforms with an emphasis on augmented and virtual reality. The tech sector and other industries perceive it as a big business and market opportunity. It is generally heralded as the “next frontier” of the internet.

The metaverse is a global virtual ecosystem where people and corporations can openly communicate, much like the global internet. But it differs in that it was created using a blend of cutting-edge, current-generation technologies, including virtual reality, blockchain, and open technical standards. When combined, these technologies create a dynamic, open virtual environment where many people will spend a large portion of their daily lives.

[**Metaverse Market**](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2022/04/25/2428281/0/en/Metaverse-Market-is-estimated-to-be-US-947-118-billion-by-2030-with-a-CAGR-of-38-8-during-the-forecast-period-By-PMI.html) is estimated to be US$ 947.118 billion by 2030 with a CAGR of 38.8% during the forecast period.

To provide more vivid and captivating digital experiences, businesses are presently creating the metaverse, which is a collection of different digital environments and situations. The innovation has a wide range of interesting applications, from platforms for augmented reality collaboration that might improve integration and cooperation to work efficiency solutions for remote teams that might, for instance, permit real estate agents to organize virtual home tours.

Let’s talk about key technologies that make Metaverse a potent answer for the challenges of the future. These technologies are also known as Metaverse developments.

- Augmented reality (AR)
- Flexible work styles
- Head-mounted displays (HMDs)
- An AR cloud
- The Internet of Things (IoT)
- 5G
- Artificial intelligence (AI)
- Spatial technologies

As of now, a combination of all these technologies can help us develop a sophisticated metaverse ecosystem. These all are the foundation bases of the future metaverse and with the advent of more technological innovations, we may see many new use cases and applications of a metaverse in the society and commercial sector.

**Some metaverse stats for you to believe :**

- The metaverse has been rated one of the top five emerging trends and technologies for 2022 by [**Gartner**](https://www.gartner.com/en/articles/5-impactful-technologies-from-the-gartner-emerging-technologies-and-trends-impact-radar-for-2022).
- The metaverse’s underlying technologies, VR/AR, are predicted to see an increase in global spending from $12 billion in 2020 to $72.8 billion in 2024 as reported by [**Forbes**](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2022/01/25/king-arthur-and-his-knights-of-the-round-table-now-the-metaverse-can-connect-workers-around-the-world-in-virtual-reality/?sh=4c33b2229f1c).
- According to a [**Greyscale**](https://grayscale.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Grayscale_Metaverse_Report_Nov2021.pdf) report, people have already spent $200 million on metaverse items.

## Understanding the Parallel Move of Metaverse & DAO

The two underlying technological phenomenons can come forward and create a robust ecosystem to provide greater efficiency and ease in our daily lives. The marriage of DAO and Metaverse is not a new thought and many companies are working towards bringing the best out of both through their amalgamation. The combination has been termed Metaverse DAO.

As per the [**CoinMarketCap**](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/metaversedao/) report, the market cap of Metaverse-DAO was recorded at $395,631.

**Let’s talk out a few use cases of this combination here.**

1. **Community-based Software & Product Development**
   DAOs eliminate the need for a centrally controlled authority, optimizing everything from wages to the planning process, and supporting community-based application and innovation via the “gig economy.”Members of DAOs can communicate and work together in novel ways that are not possible in centralized organizations. Support from the community indicates a more committed, active, and concerned community. Everything required to contribute to the creation of a community project or product, including delegating chores, giving comments, and voting in online polls can be optimized. In addition to shareholders, the community also can have a stake in the project’s success.

2. **Automating Public Governance**
   DAOs is a managerial concept that was put to the test on businesses and community organizations. Can a country implement this? To reduce the amount of welfare loss in society, governments strive to offer long-term essential infrastructure, resources, and activities. However, it is difficult to explain the complexity and significant expenditures associated with carrying out federal programs.DAO governance model is one such example.DAOs may have a constructive impact on the government. It permits a level of openness, independence, and innovation that is not feasible under the current system of government. DAOs can assist governments in self-organizing activities, fast adapting to market mechanisms and business interests, and allocating funds and resources for the genuine general welfare without the requirement for any human monitoring. DAOs will streamline administrative procedures and reduce red tape at many levels of government. Through metaverse, the public will also participate actively in giving their bit for the welfare of overall society. There will be more trust in the public regarding government efforts since it will be an open system.

3. **Crowdfunding in Metaverse**
   By assisting crowdfunding campaigns, DAOs can also be valuable outside of the blockchain and cryptocurrency industries. You should consider how DAOs can assist in crowdsourcing cash to support particular objectives if you want to know “What can a DAO be used for?” A clear illustration of how decentralized autonomous organizations might assist in raising money for a specific purpose is the Legislative DAO.

4. Investment based on NFT

   The emphasis on NFT-based investing, which has begun to pick up steam with the expansion of the DAO enabled NFT platform development market, is another of the top DAO use cases in Metaverse. Numerous NFT holders may stake their NFTs in exchange for tokens that reflect a small portion of the group’s holdings to vote and acquire tokens. One example of a DAO for NFT-based investing is HeadDAO, where members hold blue-chip NFTs collectively.

5. **Decentralized Metaverse**
   Decentralization in the metaverse will be a significant subject of debate in the “What can a DAO be used for?” debate. DAOs have been utilized by many metaverse platforms to promote decentralization by enabling users to vote on adjustments to the game and the ecosystem as a whole. Decentraland DAO, for instance, enables 3D world participants to vote on various adjustments to the network and its ecosystem.

## Notable Benefits of Metaverse DAO

DAOs enable open, worldwide communication and cooperation in virtual worlds like the metaverse. Any participant of the metaverse can obtain the openly recorded activity on the blockchain where a DAO system in the metaverse can autonomously manage operations, such as investing in real estate in the metaverse.

**Strong Framework**
There are countless issues with online communities’ privacy, however, with metaverse, everything is kept and verifiable on the blockchain. Smart contracts are used by DAOs to provide open and verifiable actions amongst members of the community. They provide a trustworthy system where participants don’t need to have faith in one another or a reliable controlling authority, but they also depend on smart contracts to provide security.

**Joint Management and Ownership**
In a metaverse, DAOs can set up joint ownership structures. The first example that comes to mind may be joint possession of an NFT; however, groups like PangeaDAO are developing metaverse land cooperatives that let users participate in shared property ownership plans. The most costly thing in the metaverse right now is virtual land. And as a result of this demand, prices have risen above the means of ordinary consumers. DAOs give consumers the option to buy land collectively, democratizing land transactions and providing access to a desirable investment.

**Exclusive Rewards**
DAOs allow each community member to make money by taking part in the decision-making process. In essence, they establish a micro-economy where users receive rewards for fulfilling chores. Concepts like “play to earn,” “learn to earn,” and “create to earn” exist in the metaverse and participants can earn their fortune with their help.

**Realizing Common Objectives & Dreams**
DAOs might focus on particular issues and work to realize common objectives and aspirations. Consider an ecological goal as an illustration. Users and organizations may be encouraged to move real-world, carbon-intensive operations into a healthy simulated space via a DAO for the metaverse that operates in line with this field.

## Conclusion

DAO Platform Development in the metaverse is seen as a novel way to encourage all members of the business, such as management, users, workers, and customers, onto the same platform for control and decision-making. This is due to the benefits of decentralization as well as the redesign of the organizational structure to one that is more democratic. It includes all the components needed to enable community members to take charge of the metaverse, earn a passive income, and truly realize the benefits of being an engaged and helpful community member.
