# Connecting the Metaverse with Bridges

## The Web3 Computer and Bridges

Computers provide value to people as platforms for application development. The raw computation, memory, and I/O can be *applied* to specific problems. A computer provides resources and services to applications, and these applications ultimately provide utility to people, or to other applications.

![The Web3 Computer](https://cryptonet.org/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsuper-static-assets.s3.amazonaws.com%2F70d25217-3b12-48f5-b837-e5a3cb5a4d4a%2Fimages%2Fb6d1cb34-57d7-4348-8990-6f9890968af8.jpg&w=3840&q=80)

The decentralised infrastructure of Web3 will be valuable in a similar way. The value of a Web3 system lies in its potential as a platform for application development. This platform is, of course, different to that of a personal computer, or a data centre, or a mobile device. Each of these is a platform for applications, providing similar basic resources of computation but with differences in architecture that give rise to different capabilities, e.g. around proximity to the user, scale, internal redundancy etc. These differences make each platform more or less suitable for certain applications, but each still ultimately provides value by supporting those applications. 

The Web3 community is building a *world computer*. Or rather, many world computers, and many applications atop them. It’s enlightening to consider an analogy between the emerging components of Web3 infrastructure and the physical components of a personal computer (or data centre etc). The analogy clarifies the basic resources that form a strong platform, and points to future developments. 

- **Blockchain VM ⟷ CPU**. A blockchain’s VM provides compute services, the execution of code. The term blockchain here includes side-chains, rollups, and other layer-two execution services that evaluate code. The dominant metric is instruction throughput.
- **Chain state ⟷ RAM**. Blockchain state represents the random-access memory of our world computers: primary storage. It’s fast to access, synchronous, but limited in size and expensive. Both code and data are stored and accessed here. (The RAM of the machines executing a blockchain is more like CPU cache in the decentralised analogy). More RAM is better.
- **Messages ⟷ I/O and IPC**. Messages from the outside world are how people interact with applications executing on the CPU. Blockchain messages are a bit richer than key presses or mouse clicks, but perform the same basic function. Messages sent between applications resemble inter-process communication. More throughput is better.

Early computers didn’t have much more than a CPU, RAM and I/O. But the next most important resources to be developed was secondary storage.

- **Filecoin ⟷ secondary storage**. Storage networks are the tape, disk, and solid state persistent storage for our world computers. Large and cheap, but slower to access. Important metrics are capacity, and latency and throughput of access.

Secondary storage supports data-intensive applications: rich media like images and audio, files, and databases. Most blockchains, like most early computers, don’t have secondary storage built-in. Filecoin’s opportunity is to be *the storage network for all world computers*, driving network effects to provide larger, cheaper, faster, and more secure storage to all.

This analogy of the Web3 platform as a PC also points to a missing, or at least underdeveloped, piece of infrastructure.

- **Bridges ⟷ network**. Bridges are how applications running on *different* world computers communicate with each other. Important metrics are latency and throughput.

Secure bridging is a hard problem. Today, I think we lack a convincing implementation of a secure, low-trust, general-purpose inter-blockchain bridge. But it’s an active area of research and development, and I expect we’ll see good bridge technology emerge in the next few years. And that’s something to strive for, because the eventual development of high-throughput, general purpose message bridging may be as transformative to the Web3 platform as the Internet was to the PC platform.

Bridges: ways in which the Metaverse can connect to external systems and environments

In many ways, it is easier to see how digital value such as NFTs and data tokens can flow in and out of each world. But it goes beyond that.

> At some point on the road towards our virtual future, we need to minimise the friction between the digital and the physical, and to allow real-world items to interface with these spaces that exist within the boundaries of our computers and our imaginations.

## Boson Protocol solves the automation of Digital to Physical redemption

Technologies such as Boson Protocol provide the means for customers to buy the virtual representation of a product in store in the knowledge that its physical counterpart will be delivered. Hence collectibles, artworks and any other artefact can be mirrored in the digital world and the real-world.

> ***As Outlier Ventures states: “Digital to Physical redemption: beyond purely digital sovereign virtual assets, new specialised protocols like Boson Protocol solve the digital to physical redemption problem, by representing physical items as NFTs which can be redeemed in the real world without the need for intermediaries. Enabling decentralized autonomous commerce across the metaverse and blurring the distinction between virtual and physical.”\***

This interface between our virtual and physical selves, enabling us to move frictionlessly between the digital and the real world is critical to get right — and transferring our assets, currencies and possessions between these worlds is an essential part of this.

For we must remember that whether we are interacting with others — whether virtually or in person — **we are always the same person, with the same state of consciousness.**

Jaron Lanier points out in Dawn of the New Everything the paradox that it is the digital world, seemingly removed from our physical selves, that can in fact reveal what makes us truly human: “Virtual reality peels away phenomena and reveals that consciousness remains and is real.”

**It is only when we have this interoperability and the possibility of transferring value and possessions between virtual worlds and between the virtual and the physical world that humans will be able to take the next significant leap in evolution and we will start being able to talk in any meaningful sense about The Metaverse instead of simply a series of generic self-contained metaverses.**

It is at this point that the Open Metaverse will begin to challenge the likes of Fortnite in scale and ambition.
