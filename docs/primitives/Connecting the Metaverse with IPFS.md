### Network driving the metaverse

The metaverse with all its enormous capabilities cannot thrive without a powerful and omnipresent connectivity architecture. Hence, the network will be the decisive enabler of the opportunities we expect the metaverse to deliver. "We need robust, flexible and extremely powerful networks. We need significant advances in latency, bandwidth and speed," says **Nishant Batra, Nokia's Chief Strategy and Technology Officer (CSTO)**. "We have already laid the connectivity foundation with 5G, but we need a continued network evolution over the next 10 years for the full metaverse ecosystem to thrive," he adds.

The networks of the next decade will need to deliver optimal connectivity and massive capacity and scale if they were to cater to the rising demands of the metaverse. Private specialized wireless, 5G-Advanced and 6G will underpin the metaverse as it expands across all sectors.  

Today, 5G gives us a sneak peek into how the metaverse will work by supporting many initial industrial AR use cases with specialized headsets and consumer AR applications over smartphones. The real change will come with the deployment of 5G-Advanced from 2025 when XR is truly unleashed. The sheer power of the network will help free the metaverse from indoor settings. More uplink bandwidth and better latency will mean amplified immersive, near-photorealistic visual overlays and superior responsive interactions. Capacity improvements will support large volumes of simultaneous XR users and facilitate the mapping of larger and more sophisticated digital twins.

## The metaverse won’t exist without the network

*Our next decade will be marked by unparalleled technological progress shaping life as we know it*

By 2030, the world will have undergone a significant transformation. The global rate of technology adoption will be impacted by trends such as environmental sustainability and cybersecurity. Advances in semiconductors, software, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) will continue to accelerate. But it will be the development of technologies that power the metaverse, cloud and Web3 that will have the potential to improve both the quality of our lives and our work. Technologies such as augmented reality (AR) will provide increasingly immersive and interactive virtual simulations in the physical world around us. Cloud computing will be central to a future internet that is both sustainable and secure. And blockchains, cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) will give power back to users in the form of ownership.



## Opening new metaverse opportunities

There's no denying the vast potential that metaverse technology offers across the consumer, enterprise and industry sectors. This is why every major company is jumping into the metaverse now. We are already seeing the positive results of metaverse applications in industries where digital twins have been integrated into operations and are delivering significant uplifts in productivity, sustainability, and worker safety. The metaverse has the potential to revolutionize the ways in which organizations engage with customers, carry out operations, create and deliver goods and services, and manage business relationships.

Imagine a fully automated, lights-out, manufacturing facility that operates without human supervision. Connected digital twins monitor and analyze the performance and health of all critical resources and processes in real-time, allowing for automated decisions such as switching production between resources to increase productivity or avoid a predicted costly failure.

## Why the network matters

The network is critical to realizing the enormous range of potential that the metaverse opens up in the industrial, enterprise and consumer spheres as we approach 2030. Nokia anticipates that the next decade will therefore usher in a period of profound change in network technology.

Built for unprecedented performance, the networks of the next decade will enable the massive capacity and scale needed to meet the growing demands of the metaverse. Metaverse services, such as fully immersive augmented and virtual reality, digital twins, and biosensors, have vastly different requirements for optimal connectivity. These requirements will eventually test the limits of even the most advanced 5G networks.



![New network capabilities](https://www.nokia.com/sites/default/files/inline-images/new-network-capabilities-tight.jpg?impolicy=.auto&imwidth=1024)Our technology vision identifies nine areas where we believe network capabilities will need to evolve to fulfill the needs anticipated in 2030.



Industrial networks will often need to be highly optimized and tailored to meet the demands of specific industries. Consumer-centric metaverse services will need to be ubiquitously available, and metaverse services generally will demand significantly increased capacity from the network – both in a downlink and uplink direction. Networks can provide these services with optimal user experience if they are able to determine the user’s context by using advanced sensing and positioning technologies. And delivering services flexibly, leveraging the capabilities of distributed cloud architecture can provide the optimal balance between user experience and network resource utilization.

Across the board, the network will need to be designed to meet the most fundamental challenges of the world in 2030, with designed-in features focusing on sustainability and efficiency, security and privacy, and resilience and agility. Intent-based autonomy will enable networks to move towards becoming fully autonomous, using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to intelligently orchestrate the network’s operations.
