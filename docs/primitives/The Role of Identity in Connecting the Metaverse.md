# The Role of Identity in Connecting the Metaverse

Not long ago, Filecoin launched the Metaverse stack (metaverse.filecoin.io) with the goal of building a secure and decentralized Metaverse in the future and encouraging developers around the world to move towards the vision of the Metaverse and its required storage needs to build.

The technical experts of Protocol Labs will also participate in the construction of the platform and popularize the relevant knowledge of the Metaverse infrastructure. Not long ago, we learned about the Metaverse's layers and the role of the Protocol Labs project in the Metaverse through its article . Today, we once again learned about the importance of "identity" in the Metaverse through experts from Protocol Labs and Stanford University.

## Identity - A vital function in the Metaverse Stack

In today's physical and digital world, our identities are the "base currency" of social and economic interaction . These include the driver's license to show to get into a bar, the facial biometrics used to unlock our phones, the clothes we wear to show ourselves visually, and even the transportation we take to get to work that proves our identities.

The world is evolving into an increasingly immersive internet known as the "Metaverse". The Metaverse consists of multiple interconnected spaces or platforms. Our identities will need to be embodied in this connected metaverse, while being interoperable and portable across spaces, platforms .

Identities in the Metaverse will allow people to move freely across space and build real societies that replicate our real-life interactions today through social, economic, and political interactions.

This critical role of identity can be depicted in a fully interconnected Metaverse stack. As explained in this [article](https://medium.com/allthingsweb-blog/the-role-of-identity-in-connecting-the-metaverse-1a3d89323025) , the Metaverse will have four layers, including infrastructure, interaction, space, and applications .

> 1/ Foundations. The underlying infrastructure of the Metaverse, including protocols and blockchains, compute, storage, information flow, regulations, and standards.
>
> 2/ Primitive Functions. The mechanisms of interaction that enable someone to express themself, prove who they are, transact, show what they own, and communicate with others. Identity is a core
>
> 3/ Interconnected Spaces. The ‘worlds’ in which we will engage and interact. It can be in 2D or 3D and be rendered on a screen, VR or AR headset.
>
> 4/ Apps & Experiences. The real tasks and interactions people will do, purposeful and relating to their lives, in a space, using some or multiple primitive functions to interact with objects or agents.

In addition to basic payment, communication, and ownership functions, "identity" provides a key raw capability for creating experiences and applications that allow us to express ourselves, prove who we are, and transact . In general, this has many similarities to decentralized identity and is one of the hallmarks of Web3 across the board.

In the Metaverse, identity will consist of three aspects.

- **Avatars** . _ Avatars represent what we want to visually present to others in a social or professional setting. Includes representative and non-representative digital characters, skins and other clothing and accessories, and PFP (profile picture) NFTs.
- **Credentials** . _ Credentials are about someone verifying themselves, like a driver's license or an ID card, it's part of proving our identity, providing trust in human interactions and transactions. Credentials must be attested and are usually verified by a third party rather than asserted themselves. Such as credit scores, government ID cards, or credentials such as college degrees.
- **Personal** data . Personal data is an integral part of our identity and can be asserted without proof. This includes shopping history and preferences, clothing sizing, and association and subscription data on social media platforms.

## Operating Model and Roles for Identity in the Metaverse

In the operating model of Metaverse identities, the consumers of these identities are the foundation of applications and experiences in the Metaverse world . However, in order to use identity, identity infrastructure must provide the connection between identity aspects and applications and experiences (e.g. wallets are infrastructure for sharing credentials, decentralized identifiers include avatars, credentials and data bindings). The way identities are used must also be governed by standards and frameworks.

This operating model divides the organizations or individuals involved in the construction of the market structure into four different roles.

- **Creator of spaces and applications** . Refers to roles in the Metaverse that use our identities to create spaces and applications. For example, Decentraland creates a world where users can socially interact with others through their avatars.
- **Builders of identity infrastructure** . The job of these characters is to make connections that make every aspect of each identity usable in the Metaverse. For example, Metamask built a wallet that currently allows our payment identities to connect with DeFi applications.
- **Identity provider** . These actors provide key attributes of the identities we use. For example, Yuga Labs has created publicly recognized NFTs that can be used as profile pictures and memberships in the Bored Ape Yacht Club 'Otherside' Metaverse.
- **Framework and standard setter** . These roles set the standards and rules by which identities operate. For example, the Open Metaverse Interoperability Group (OMI Group) is working on designing and promoting things like identity, social graphs, and inventory protocols.

## Conclusion

In summary, identity is the core function that enables everyone to recreate social and economic interactions in the online Metaverse , enabling everyone to be the way they want and to prove who they are in another form , allowing for easy interaction .

It includes three key aspects - avatars, credentials and personal data; and requires establishing an identity infrastructure and defining standards to help everyone in the open metaverse be able to use identities.
