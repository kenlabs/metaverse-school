# Introduction

How does the Metaverse work? The model for user identity, ownership, and reputation. The mechanics and physics of the world. Can users fly? Run? How fast? Can objects be stacked on top of each other? Attached to buildings? Programmability and agents - in what ways can elements of the world be automated - and can autonomous digital agents interact with the world? 

Recently, [**Mckinsey & Company published a report titled Value creation in the metaverse**](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/business functions/marketing and sales/our insights/value creation in the metaverse/Value-creation-in-the-metaverse.pdf). Therein they discussed four components of Metaverse

- Enablers,
- Infrastructure
- Platforms, and
- Content

**Enablers** lay the foundation for the complex Metaverse structure. They cover foundational aspects like governance, security, and privacy. They also facilitate the operation of the Metaverse economy. Core technologies i.e. Web 3.0, Blockchain, AI, Cryptocurrencies, and NFTs operate in this component.

**Infrastructure** component covers the hardware and software requirements for the Metaverse. Such as Devices, Operating Systems, Cloud, Semiconductors networks, accessories, etc.

**Platforms & Tools** facilitate the creation and deployment of Metaverse experiences. These are Web browsers, Dapps, App stores, Game engines, AI services, etc. Artificial Intelligence as well as immersive technologies like AR, VR, Unity, and Unreal operate in this component.

**Content** component is where developers, creators, and even users are active. They will create the content and experiences that will drive the Metaverse. Here, they can use immersive technologies like Unity, Unreal, Cryengine, TensorFlow, etc.

Further, the above-mentioned four components can be broken down into ten layers. Let’s have a glance over the layer. 

*Enablers consist of 3 layers:*

1. Payment & Monetization

   - Facilitating the Metaverse economy. 

   - Storing and trading digital assets

   - Other digital Transactions

1. Identity

   - Digital Identities management 

   - Avatar creation, 

   - Other safety measures and authentication

1. Security, Privacy, and Governance

   - User privacy protection

   - Governance and other authority supervision


*Infrastructure consist of two layers:*

1. Hardware

   - Complex computing 

   - Networking infrastructure

1. Devices, OS, & Accessories

   - User Interfaces 

   - AR Devices

   - VR Devices


*Platforms consist of two layers:*

1. Access & Discovery

   - Metaverse content distribution

   - App stores

1. Creators Platform

   - Content creation

   - Virtual environment development


*The content component consists of three layers:*

1. Content

   - Content Creation 

   - Experience development

1. Application
   - Industry-specific applications
   - Dapps

1. Virtual Worlds
   - Metaverse spaces 
   - Metaverse activities
   - Content deployment
