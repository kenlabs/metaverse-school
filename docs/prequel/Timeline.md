### Incubation. 

In 1979, the first Multi-User Dungeon (MUD)6 appeared. It uses a text interface to connect multiple users together in real time, forming an open social and cooperative world. In 1986, Habitat, the world’s first MUD online game with a 2D graphical interface, was launched. It is considered the forerunner of modern massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs)7 , allowing humans to enter virtual worlds for the first time using avatars. In 1984, Canadian writer William Ford Gibson coined the word "cyberspace" in his science fiction novel Neuromancer, which also gave rise to the "cyberpunk" culture. The novel depicts the rich virtual space behind the computer screen, giving people an advanced look into the digital world of the future. The concept of "Metaverse" and "avatar" was first explicitly introduced in 1992 by Neil Stephenson in his novel Snow Crash [10]. In the novel, a real human and a virtual human live together in a virtual space through VR equipment, showing the space-time extension and man-machine symbiosis of the Metaverse. The Metaverse has been on the scene ever since. 



### Preparation. 

The most likely starting point for the Metaverse implementation is the gaming sector. In 1994, Web World, the first multiplayer social game with an axonometric interface, was introduced. In this game, users can socialize in real time and transform the game world. The user generated content (UGC)8 mode was enabled. In 1995, Worlds Inc.9 became the first massively multiplayer online game (MMOG or more commonly MMO)10 to market, hoping that users could conduct open social interactions in 3D space. In 1995, based on the novel Snow Crash, Active Worlds11 was created. Active Worlds provides users with basic content creation tools to personalize 3D virtual environments. In 2003, Linden Laboratory in the United States developed the phenomenallevel virtual world "Second Life", which has powerful world editing functions. Unlike previous digital games, this game has a virtual economy that generates value in the real world and can be used in areas such as education. Therefore, a large number of enterprises and institutions were attracted. In 2006, the multiplayer online creation game Roblox was officially released. With a rudimentary version of the Metaverse, the majority of the works in the game are user-created, interactive, and linked to real life. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, people’s social lives are gradually moving online. The rapid growth of the demand for online interaction accelerates the maturity of emerging technologies such as XR, digital twins, and blockchain. The development of the Metaverse has entered the early stages of explosion. 



### Rise period. 

2021 is considered likely to be the first year of the Metaverse. Roblox went public in March 2021 with the title of "the first stock of the Metaverse", which triggered a heated discussion about the Metaverse. In May 2021, the Google I/O conference announced a 3D video calling technology called Starline. In October 2021, Facebook changed its corporate name to Meta, taking the prefix from the Metaverse, officially starting a comprehensive transformation from a social media platform to the Metaverse ecosystem. In November 2021, numerous companies began to turn their attention to the Metaverse. Microsoft announced at the Ignite conference that it has officially entered the Metaverse field and will launch Mesh12 for Microsoft Teams software to assist in office work. NVIDIA launched Omniverse13, a platform for generating interactive AI avatars. It can help creators build virtual characters in the Metaverse. Disney will take the Metaverse as its future development direction and build a supporting IP image. In January 2022, Microsoft acquired Activision Blizzard, the world’s largest game developer and publisher, for $68.7 billion. So far, the development of the Metaverse has entered a stage of rapid development. The detailed timeline of the Metaverse is shown in Fig. 2.
