# The History of the Metaverse

The term 'metaverse' has only recently gained currency, but its history is long. Learn about the technologies that gave rise to a concept many believe will change civilization.

### Introduction

The buzz around the metaverse continues to grow, sparked by the social media giant Facebook rebranding itself as Meta and amplified by company after company [marketing its version of a metaverse experience](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/Marketing-in-the-metaverse-What-marketers-need-to-know).

While the term [metaverse](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/The-metaverse-explained-Everything-you-need-to-know) has only recently gained currency, the concept of an immersive, 3D internet that will transform how people live their lives has been around for decades. This article takes readers though a history of the metaverse, with an emphasis on the technology breakthroughs that gave rise to it.

At present, the metaverse is largely unbuilt, and there are [competing visions of what the metaverse will be like](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/tip/Metaverse-vs-multiverse-vs-omniverse-Key-differences) and which technologies will power it. But broadly speaking, the metaverse will likely include a blend of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality ([AR](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/augmented-reality-AR)) experiences. It may also use new decentralized finance technologies like [blockchains](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/feature/Top-9-blockchain-platforms-to-consider) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to harmonize commerce and interoperability across platforms.

The metaverse will likely comprise numerous [3D](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/3-D-three-dimensions-or-three-dimensional) worlds, many of them aimed at consumers and some, like the so-called industrial metaverse and infrastructure metaverse, designed to transform how work gets done. The latter implementations might be built on the centralized services already running on the large cloud platforms enterprises use and emerging platforms like [Nvidia's Omniverse](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/news/252525158/Nvidia-unveils-Omniverse-Cloud-for-metaverse-applications).

While it is [early days for the metaverse](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/feature/The-Metaverse-Standards-Forum-What-you-need-to-know), and there are fundamental technical barriers to be removed, there is a growing consensus that it will happen and will arrive with a big bang.

"It is clear that it is one of the most highly anticipated technology evolutions of the coming decade," said Dave Wright, chief innovation officer at ServiceNow.

Wright believes businesses need to plan for two vital shifts as they plan for this evolution. The first is how they will manage the flow of [work within the metaverse](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/tip/How-will-the-metaverse-affect-the-future-of-work). The second is how they will manage the flow of assets and work between virtual and physical worlds.

Revisiting the history of the metaverse can help inform these plans.

### Technology that has contributed to the metaverse: An annotated timeline

Here are some of the most significant technology developments shaping the current visions of the metaverse, with commentary from experts:

1938 -- French poet and playwright Antonin Artaud uses the term *virtual reality* in his collection of essays, *The Theater and its Double*. He paints a vision of how characters, objects and images can be orchestrated to create rich, immersive worlds.

1962 -- American filmmaker Morton Heilig builds the Sensorama, a machine that simulates the experience of riding a motorcycle through New York City via a 3D movie, vibrating chair, fan and smells. "The Sensorama was by far the ultimate advancement which laid the groundwork for what the immersive virtual environment could become," said John Licata, vice president and chief innovation foresight strategist at SAP New Venture Technologies Future Hub.

1984 -- American computer scientist, musician and virtual reality pioneer Jaron Lanier founds VPL Research, Inc. The firm developed one of the first VR headsets and data gloves. It creates demonstrations of how virtual reality could be deployed for commercial and artistic endeavors. "While there's a host of prior thinking and experiments (including a great 1965 paper by Ivan Sutherland imagining an 'Ultimate Display' that recognizably describes this sci-fi staple), Jaron Lanier's VPL Research started to commercialize goggles and gloves to facilitate augmented reality and virtual reality interactions," said Alex Weishaupl, managing director with Protiviti Digital.

1989 -- English computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee lays the groundwork for the World Wide Web while at CERN. This was a radical upgrade to existing text-based sharing services like Gopher and proprietary bulletin board systems. Berners-Lee's invention open-sourced both a client and server for a linked network of web pages with text, graphics and audio.

1992 -- American sci-fi writer Neal Stephenson coins the term *metaverse* in his book *Snow Crash*, which depicts dystopian future world where rich people escape into an alternative 3D, connected reality. The alternative reality starts out as a single 65,536 km road circling an artificial globe and expands from there as people buy, build and renovate virtual real estate. In this vision, there is just one world that everyone connects through. People are responsible for their own avatars, which range from highly artistic customized creations to cheap commodity offerings from Walmart nicknamed "Clints" and "Brandys."

1993 -- Israeli computer scientist Moni Naor and American computer scientist Cynthia Dwork invent proof-of-work techniques to deter spam and denial-of-service attacks. The software requires participants to solve a complex cryptographic challenge that is easy to verify. The basic concepts are later formalized and become the basis of Bitcoin.

2003 -- Linden Lab unveils Second Life, a shared 3D virtual space that allows users to explore, interact with others, build things and exchange virtual goods. The virtual space set the stage for what a shared virtual world could look like and has continued to grow throughout the present, with over 70 million registered Second Life accounts. "Major organizations like IBM, Coca-Cola, and others invested significant effort in figuring out how this 3-D platform could foster customer interactions and employee experiences, which are themes we see trialed again in the metaverse of today," Weishaupl said.

2006 -- Roblox allows users to create and play massively multiplayer games developed by other users. Users could try out their new ideas for a game, and the platform provided the infrastructure to scale the most successful ones rapidly. The Roblox platform also allows users to create and sell new items. Adoption took off during the Covid-19 pandemic, and the platform now has over 200 million users.

2007 -- Google augments Maps with Street View, which allows people to explore a virtual representation of the real world at scale. "Beyond the cool immersive-ness of the product itself, Google showed there are clever, easy ways of creating large, complex digital twins of physical environments for users to explore," Weishaupl said.

2009 -- Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) mints the first Bitcoin and launches the first public blockchain using a proof-of-work algorithm. It slowly grows into the most valuable cryptocurrency, demonstrating the potential for decentralized ledgers to protect trade at scale. Wild speculation drives interest in various alternative cryptocurrencies and research on new ways to implement decentralized markets outside the control of any one party.

2010 -- The gacha video game model is introduced. Players play toy vending machines (*gachas*) to earn currency and in-game rewards through a combination of luck and skill.

2011 -- Ernest Cline publishes futuristic novel *Ready Player One*. Set in the 2040s, humanity finds escape in a shared virtual world called OASIS, which boasts having the world's most stable currency. Steven Spielberg directs the movie version in 2018, popularizing the idea of a shared virtual world.

2012 -- Israeli entrepreneur Yoni Assia introduces Colored Coins in a 2012 blog post titled "bitcoin 2.X (aka Colored Bitcoin) - initial specs." This lays the foundation for a novel way to create, buy, sell and own assets on top of a public blockchain.

2012 -- American entrepreneur Palmer Luckey launches the Oculus on Kickstarter as the first low-cost 3D hardware for the masses.

2014 -- Facebook buys Oculus and helps scale the 3D infrastructure to support it.

2014 -- Americans Kevin McCoy, an artist, and Anil Dash, a tech entrepreneur, create the first non-fungible token, a unique cryptographically secured virtual asset. This opens the door for experimentation in virtual art, concert tickets and new play-to-earn experiences. "The fast growth and general acceptance of the paradigm was a critical milestone for the metaverse," said Frank Palermo, executive vice-president and head of technology at Virtusa, a digital engineering consultancy.

2015 -- Canadian programmer Vitalik Buterin and English computer scientist Gavin Wood launch Ethereum, which includes features for building decentralized apps on a blockchain. "Ethereum introduced a practical take on smart contracts, which is the foundation for offerings like NFTs and the ability to 'own' assets in a distributed environment," Weishaupl said.

2016 -- Pok√©mon GO introduces the world to AR games overlaid on the real world. Players use their phones to find, capture and battle virtual creatures associated with physical locations.

2016 -- The DAO, an early decentralized autonomous organization for raising VC funds, launches on top of the Ethereum blockchain. Hackers siphon off a third of its funds a month after it launches. This kills the company, but the idea inspires new models for collectively buying assets and running organizations.

2018 -- Video play-to-earn game Axie Infinity, developed by Vietnamese studio Sky Mavis, popularizes the use of NFTs integrated into the Ethereum blockchain. It peaks at over 2.7 million users at the height of the pandemic in 2021, with the highest combined value of all play-to-earn games. Hackers steal around $600 million in 2022.

2019 -- Epic Games's Fortnite becomes the most popular shared virtual world ever, with over 250 million active users. The company enhances the platform to support other virtual games and experiences. In 2020, rapper Travis Scott performs a virtual concert that attracts more than 12 million participants. Epic later integrates the platform into popular enterprise apps for geographic information systems, design and infrastructure.

2021 -- Facebook's parent company rebrands itself as Meta and promulgates an upbeat and expansive vision for the metaverse. The renamed company subsequently invests over $10 billion to develop new hardware, software and services to support this new world. This helps galvanize interest in the term *metaverse* as companies of all shapes and sizes begin connecting their existing offerings to the metaverse. Google search rankings for the term skyrocket.

2021 -- Microsoft introduces Mesh as a new platform that promises to synchronize virtual collaboration. The company touts how metaverse experiences via Mesh could improve enterprise workflows for meetings, construction and making movies.

2022 -- Siemens and Nvidia partner on the industrial metaverse. The new term builds on Nvidia's Omniverse collaborative engineering environment and Siemen's comprehensive platform of [digital twin](https://www.techtarget.com/searcherp/definition/digital-twin) tools for aerospace, healthcare, manufacturing, automotive and energy industries. "Photorealistic, physics-based digital twins embedded in the industrial metaverse offer enormous potential to transform our economies and industries by providing a virtual world where people can interact and collaborate to solve real-world problems," said Roland Busch, president and CEO of Siemens AG.

## 1991 ‚Äì Birth of the Internet

On the 6th of August 1991, Tim Berners-Lee posted the very first public invitation for collaboration on the WorldWideWeb. This is the date the Internet was born.

## 1992 ‚Äì Snow Crash
The very next year, science fiction writer Neal Stephenson coined the term ‚Äúmetaverse‚Äù in his 1992 novel Snow Crash, where humans, as avatars, interact with each other and software agents, in a three-dimensional virtual space that uses the metaphor of the real world.

## 1993 ‚Äì Proof of Work
The term and concept were introduced in the context of computer security as a way to prevent email spamming. Later, proof work became one of the primary techniques for verifying and legitimizing transactions on a blockchain, specifically ‚Äì cyber currency mining based on computer power.

## 1998 ‚Äì B-Money
Computer engineer Wei Dei revealed his concept for b-money, a decentralized, distributed cryptocurrency. It never came to pass but some of the concepts are very similar to those in Bitcoin, which emerged years later. One element was the use of Proof of Stake, an alternative mining algorithm that relies on the developer‚Äôs current holdings of the cryptocurrency rather than raw computing power.

## 2002 ‚Äì Digital Twins
The concept and model of the digital twin ‚Äì the digital counterpart of a physical object ‚Äì was publicly introduced in 2002 by Michael Grieves, then of the University of Michigan, at a Society of Manufacturing Engineers conference. Grieves proposed the digital twin as the conceptual model underlying product lifecycle management.

## 2003 ‚Äì Second Life
Second Life is the online virtual world, developed by Philip Rosedale and his team at Linden Lab in 2003. It was very much a precursor to the Metaverse worlds being developed today. One of the biggest problems Second Life users faced was low bandwidths and high ‚Äúres‚Äù times making it a less-than-optimal experience. But even today, Second Life has an active user base of a million people, each spending over four hours a day in this virtual world.

Futurist Speaker Thomas Frey Blog: Roblox is an Online Platform that allows Users to Create and Play Games

## 2006 ‚Äì Roblox
This online platform was introduced that allowed users to create and play games developed by other users. During the 2020 pandemic, it became a significant source of interaction for young people, and it became the third-highest-grossing game that year.

## 2009 ‚Äì Bitcoin
On the 3rd of January in 2009, the bitcoin network came into existence with its mysterious founder, Satoshi Nakamoto, mining the genesis block of bitcoin (block number 0), which yielded a reward of 50 bitcoins. This was the day Bitcoin was born.

## 2009 ‚Äì Blockchain
Along with the invention of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto also invented blockchain to serve as the public transaction ledger for Bitcoin. Even though others have claimed to have invented the concept of blockchain earlier, the same day that Bitcoin was launched is the same day that a usable form of Blockchain was born.

## 2010 ‚Äì Play-to-Earn Technology
Gacha games had grown popular in Japan by the early 2010s, based on the capsule toy vending machine concept, with the earliest known system being in MapleStory. Players would earn currency that they could use to participate in a random draw from a set of items based on pre-determined rarities, often with the goal to collect all of a one set of items to gain a powerful in-game reward.

## 2011 ‚Äì Ready Player One
This novel by Ernest Cline introduced many young people to the concept of a virtual reality world. The Steven Spielberg adaptation in 2018 made the idea even more vivid and the interest more widespread.

## 2012 ‚Äì NFTs
An NFT or ‚ÄúNifty‚Äù is a Non-Fungible Token, representing a unique item instead of fungible tokens, which are mutually interchangeable, such as cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. The concept of NFTs has been with us since December 2012 with the creation of ‚ÄúColored Coins,‚Äù in which additional information is incorporated onto a bitcoin so that it is no longer fungible but unique. This, interestingly enough, was a project spearheaded by a young Vitalik Buterin as he worked on improvements for the Bitcoin blockchain.

## 2014 ‚Äì Vitalik Buterin
The Thiel Fellowship ‚Äì In 1999, Peter Thiel‚Äôs company Confinity merged with Elon Musk‚Äôs company X.com to form PayPal. Three years later, eBay bought PayPal for $1.5 billion, making both Musk and Thiel very wealthy. In 2010, Peter Thiel announced the formation of the Thiel Fellowship, offering $100,000 grants for students under the age of 22 to leave school and pursue other work. In 2014, one of the recipients of this grant was 20-year-old Vitalik Buterin, the co-creator of Ethereum.

## 2015 ‚Äì Ethereum
In July of 2015, Vitalik Buterin and Gavin Wood launched the Ethereum Network, along with the ethereum blockchain.

## 2015 ‚Äì Decentraland
The first iteration of this virtual reality platform was introduced in 2015. It allocated ‚Äúland‚Äù via a proof of work algorithm. The 2021 boom in NFTs has led to sales of some of the game‚Äôs real estate plots for more than $100,000.

## 2015 ‚Äì Smart Contracts
Smart contracts were first proposed in the early 1990s by Nick Szabo, who coined the term to refer to ‚Äúa set of promises, specified in digital form, including protocols within which the parties perform on these promises.‚Äù Since the 2015 launch of the Ethereum blockchain, the term ‚Äúsmart contract‚Äù has been more specifically applied toward the notion of general-purpose computation that takes place on a blockchain or distributed ledger.

## 2016 ‚Äì Pok√©mon GO
Pok√©mon Go was the first game to overlay a virtual world onto the real world. It uses mobile devices with GPS to locate, capture, train, and battle virtual creatures, called Pok√©mon, which appear as if they are in the player‚Äôs real-world location.

## 2016 ‚Äì The DAO ‚Äì Decentralized Autonomous Organizations
The company named The DAO was launched through a crowdfunded token sale in May 2016, setting the record for the largest crowdfunding campaign in history at that time. It was meant to be an alternative venture capital fund, created on Ethereum‚Äôs blockchain, that would serve as a decentralized funding model. In June 2016, users exploited a vulnerability in The DAO code which enabled them to siphon off one-third of DAO‚Äôs funds into a subsidiary account. This led to the death of The DAO as a company. But the concept of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) lives on, yet substantially improved by lessons learned from The DAO experience. Moving forward, each DAO will serve as an essential ingredient for future metaverse companies that are governed collectively by participants in the organization, with rules and financial transactions recorded on the blockchain. DAOs, for example, have been formed around joint ownership of NFTs.

Futurist Speaker Thomas Frey Blog: Fortnite is a Multiplayer Video Game to feel the Metaverse and Cryptocurrency
## 2017 ‚Äì Fortnite
This multiplayer video game was a huge success upon its release, and it introduced many people to the look and feel of the metaverse and cryptocurrency. Fortnite user base totals 350 million.

## 2018 ‚Äì Dai Stablecoin
The Dai Stablecoin was introduced to add a new element to the volatile crypto universe. In contrast to cryptocurrencies that aren‚Äôt anchored to any fiat currency or are only anchored to other cryptocurrencies, the centralized Dai Stablecoin was pegged to the U.S. dollar, making it far less volatile and more reliable cryptocurrency for decentralized finance (DeFi). Today, blockchain-based banking services are available on a number of similar platforms for cryptocurrency borrowing, lending, and investing. For now, they‚Äôre largely unregulated by our traditional institutions, and users seem just fine with that, for the most part.

## 2018 ‚Äì Decentralized Exchanges (DEX)
Cyber currency exchanges took a major PR hit when Bancor lost $13.5 million to hackers. Although their legal/regulatory foundation remains a little uncertain, DEXes continue to serve as a way for people to sell and trade their cyber currency assets person-to-person based on smart contracts, rather than through a centralized exchange.

## 2018 ‚Äì Axie Infinity
The popular NFT virtual reality game, Axie Infinity, based on a mythical world of animal husbandry, was introduced this year. By mid-2021 it had the highest combined value of NFTs of all play-to-earn game platforms.

## 2020 ‚Äì COVID
When COVID exploded on the scene in 2020, people around the world found themselves being quarantined with few options to dedicate their time and energy to. For this reason, the metaverse quickly became the go-to place for a growing number of young people, gamers, and those wanting to make money in the online world. In our polarized world, the metaverse has taken on a tone of rebelling against current institutions ‚Äì the more ingrained they are more they‚Äôre at risk. This is pushing people to the underground economies and worlds of the metaverse, setting up a ‚Äúperfect storm‚Äù for Metaverse growth.

## 2020 ‚Äì Decentralized Apps (Dapps)
The value of the tokens on the six major blockchain platforms surpassed $2 billion. The movement to cut out the middleman continues, as open-source, transparent applications continue to emerge to enable gaming, DEXes, DeFi, and other acronymized uses. While many people refer to dapps as an emerging trend, the first dapp was actually the Bitcoin app more than a decade ago.

## 2020 ‚Äì First Concert in the Metaverse
In April 2020, Travis Scott and Marshmello performed in the video game, Fortnite to just under 30 million people.

## 2020 ‚Äì Solana
Also in April, the Solana blockchain dapp was introduced. In contrast to Ethereum, this dapp‚Äôs cryptocurrency, called a SOL, is mined based on the alternate proof of stake (POS) algorithm. Further, issues related to block ownership were clarified and simplified in Solana, with a new consensus tool known as ‚Äúproof of history‚Äù that inserts timestamps into its blockchain.

## 2020 ‚Äì Alien Worlds
This wildly popular dapp was created with a multi-metaverse interplanetary scenario that had NFT characters interacting in a decentralized autonomous organization to mine tokens and perform other tasks. By 2021 Alien Worlds had more than 2.5 million users, but its significance goes beyond that ‚Äì the game has been built around critical lessons for teaching people about the principles of cryptocurrency and crypto-mining.

## 2021 - Future
The evolution of various kinds of enabling technology and new features in the metaverse over the last few years has been incredible. But not as amazing as it will be beyond 2021.

In fact, in the future, there will be few if any aspects of society ‚Äì including government, business, churches, entertainment, dating, politics, and even war ‚Äì that will remain unchanged with the evolving Metaverse. It will have an especially profound effect on the way we educate ourselves and our children in the years ahead.
