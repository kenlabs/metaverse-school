Metaverse has become ae buzzword in the tech industry. Not a single day goes by without a mention of it in the media, especially around investments, startups building components, new platforms being announced and large companies entering this world of digital engagement. There is undeniably a huge momentum of an almost real 3D virtual world, and the clarion call was perhaps Facebook rebranding itself as Meta which will perhaps be remembered as a red letter moment in the evolution of the Metaverse. While the Metaverse can seem like a fairly new concept, the origin of Metaverse dates back to 1992 when Neal Stephenson coined the term in his science-fiction novel “Snow Crash” and early glimpses of it showed up a decade back from Roblox. For very obvious reasons, the reactions in the market were mixed. For instance, Fortnite, developed by Epic Games, started out as a successful 4-player game but soon ended up becoming one of the coolest online hangouts for Gen-Z.The resultant hype caused it to pivot towards becoming a social platform that recently hosted virtual concerts of Ariana Grande and Travis Scott, not surprisingly, attended by millions of music lovers in virtual avatars. Metaverse can be best described as persistent, connected virtual realities where people work, play, and socialize: anytime, anywhere, and from any device. It is the convergence of the physical, augmented, and virtual reality where users can interact with each other in real-time scenarios. It’s a revolutionary form of digital interaction with endless, untapped potential that holds massive opportunities in the marketplace. This immersive virtual world that Metaverse aims to bring to us will not just be limited to user engagement but can be envisaged as an extension of the real world where organizations and people come together to invest, build, and trade products and services. It is the next-generation internet that will transport us to an immersive and hyper-realistic digital world. While the concept is not fully evolved yet, it is certain that new-age technologies such as AR/VR/MR, IoT, AI, 5G and Blockchain will become an enabling force to create a full-blown interconnected virtual world. It is no wonder that companies around the globe have placed big bets on it. 

Recent technology advancements and the emergence of the tech-savvy Gen Z is expected to speed up the adoption of the Metaverse. Factors that are significantly contributing to this growing trend are:

Pandemic and the shift to hybrid work arrangements 

Consumerization of AR/VR headsets 

High-Speed networks 

Advances in AI, IoT, and Cloud Infrastructure 

Shift in customer preferences towards digital asset investments and virtual experiences 

Evolution of Web 3.0



# Learn How to Build for the Creator Economy

As a fusion of various emerging digital technologies, the Metaverse aims to build a virtual shared digital space. It is closely related to extended reality, digital twin, blockchain, and other technologies. Its goal is to build a digital space based on the real world, form a virtual economic system, and expand the space of human activities, which injects new vitality into the social, economic, and other fields. 



In this course, we make the following contributions. We first introduce the basic concepts such as the development process, definition, and characteristics of the Metaverse. After that, we analyze the overall framework and supporting technologies of the Metaverse and summarize the status of common fields. 

Finally, we focus on the security and privacy issues that exist in the Metaverse, and give corresponding solutions or directions. We also discuss the challenges and possible research directions of the Metaverse.
