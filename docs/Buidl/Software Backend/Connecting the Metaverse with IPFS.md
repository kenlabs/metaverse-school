Qiyiyun: Why is it necessary for Metaverse to accurately combine with IPFS?

Basically, all products of Metaverse will be NFT, but this will lead to more and more NFT data. This is where Metaverse seeks to make breakthroughs. The important thing is that the data must be stored permanently, and the data cannot be manipulated to ensure uniqueness. As you may have guessed, there is a product that meets these requirements in block shark, that is, IPFS distributed storage.

Filecoin is an incentive layer that runs on the IPFS and blockchain distributed memory network. It transforms cloud memory into an algorithmic market, in which tokens play a very important role. Token is an interconnection bridge between users (IPFS users) who exchange resources (storage and retrieval). The Filecoin protocol has two trading markets: data retrieval and data storage. Both parties of the transaction put forward their own needs in the market and completed the transaction.

IPFS and Filecoin promote each other, grow together, and solve the problem of data storage and data distribution on the Internet. Especially with the development of many blockchain projects, IPFS and Filecoin have become an infrastructure. Therefore, we can see that more and more blockchain projects use IPFS as a storage solution because it provides a cheaper, safer, and faster storage solution.

Data of cultural significance is already stored in the Filecoin network: The entire Wikipedia database is stored in the Filecoin network, which not only helps to expand the coverage of Wikipedia, but also helps to check whether these valuable public data are freely accessible .
