# Opportunities in the Metaverse

The elements of a new digital age are converging at scale. The metaverse
 is the driving force bringing these elements together in a unified, immersive experience.

We are not here to suggest the metaverse, as we know it today, will take over all human interactions, but rather, to explore the many exciting opportunities it presents for consumers and brands alike. Whether it’s large tech players such as Microsoft planning to create realistic workspaces, or Ariana Grande holding a concert in Fortnite, the opportunities presented by interactive, digital worlds seem limitless. The metaverse will likely infiltrate every sector in some way in the coming years, with the market opportunity estimated at over $1 trillion in yearly revenues.6

As a result, we see companies of all shapes and sizes entering the metaverse
 in different ways, including household names like Walmart, Nike, Gap, Verizon, Hulu, PWC, Adidas, Atari and others.7 Business leaders and boardrooms around the world are now asking themselves, “What is my metaverse strategy? What am I supposed to be doing in the metaverse? What is the metaverse anyway?”

## What is the metaverse?

The metaverse is a seamless convergence of our physical and digital lives, creating a unified, virtual community where we can work, play, relax, transact and socialize. The metaverse is still early in its evolution, and there is no singular, all-encompassing definition to which people can turn. Themes of what the metaverse is and could be, however, are emerging. A key point is that there is no one virtual world but many worlds, which are taking shape to enable people to deepen and extend social interactions digitally. This is done by adding an immersive, three-dimensional layer to the web, creating more authentic

and natural experiences. The metaverse even has the promise of facilitating accessibility from the comfort of the home, breaking down boundaries and democratizing access to key goods, services and experiences.

Before diving deeper into the metaverse, it’s important to lay the foundation between features of today’s metaverse—Web 2.0 characteristics, and the emerging Web 3.0 characteristics. While the table below highlights our assessment of the key metaverse features between the two, the lines are blurring as more and more traditional virtual worlds are adopting elements of the blockchain-based worlds.

## Why metaverse? Why now?

The concept of a metaverse is not a new one. In many ways this is a linear progression. Online, multi-player, role-playing worlds like The Sims or Second Life have been around for nearly 20 years, with players spending an average of 20 hours per week in these worlds.9 Modern equivalents like Minecraft, World of Warcraft and Fortnite have hundreds of millions of users, and huge supporting economies.

We are now at an inflection point, where it seems that not a day goes by
 without a company or celebrity announcing that they are building a presence
 in a virtual universe. While the buzz can partially be attributed to attention- grabbing headlines, there is a convergence of emerging trends. A number of new technologies have come together to enable this vision of the metaverse. Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) headsets have become cheaper and more powerful, improving the user experience. Blockchain has enabled digital currencies and NFTs. The new methods to transact and own digital goods are allowing creators to monetize their activities through tokens. In addition
 to monetization, and as a means to exchange value, token-holders can also participate in the platform’s governance (e.g. vote on decisions). This democratic ownership economy coupled with the possibility of interoperability, could unlock immense economic opportunities, whereby digital goods and services are no longer captive to a singular gaming platform or brand.

From a social perspective, the development of more immersive virtual experiences is helping people to build communities based on shared values, and to express themselves in more authentic ways. Meanwhile, COVID-19 accelerated the digitization of our lives and normalized more persistent and multi-purpose online engagement and communication. It is this combination of technological, social and economic drivers that is resulting in the explosive interest in the metaverse.

## Metanomics

When you think about the economics of the metaverse—or metanomics—there are opportunities in almost every market area. Imagine you have an online avatar and you want to change what it/you are wearing, you will be able to buy limited-edition, digitally branded clothing that you pick after browsing a virtual showroom. Or you may start your own small business, such as an art gallery where you display your latest and greatest collections, or a virtual private club.

According to [JP Morgan’s report](https://www.jpmorgan.com/content/dam/jpm/treasury-services/documents/opportunities-in-the-metaverse.pdf), the economics of the metaverse – or metanomics – offers opportunities in almost every area and poses a market opportunity of US$1 trillion in annual revenue.

So, what opportunities does the bank see? According to JP Morgan’s report, the metaverse offers opportunities to:

- **Transact** – every year, US$54bn is spent on virtual goods, almost double the amount spent buying music
- **Socialise** – approximately US$60bn messages are sent daily on Roblox
- **Create** – GDP for Second Life was around US$650m in 2021 with nearly US$80m US dollars paid to creators
- **Own** – NFTs currently have a market cap of US$41bn
- **Experience** – 200 strategic partnerships to date with The Sandbox, including Warner Music Group to launch a music-themed virtual world

## The growth of the ownership economy

Metanomics is not a new term or concept. Its origins lead back to 2007 when
 a Cornell professor, Rob Bloomfield, hosted a course on the subject in Second Life.10 Many of the themes Bloomfield covered resonate today, including drawing parallels between the physical and digital real estate markets. However, a key difference today is the ownership economy, driven by the advent of Web 3.0. If you want to personalize a virtual home, you can purchase an original piece of art, tokenized as a digital asset. You can even own the land the house is built on. Ethereum-based platforms like Decentraland, for example, are already selling virtual plots that people can develop. Virtual real estate is a growing market. The average price of a parcel of land doubled in a six-month window in 2021. It jumped from $6,000 in June to $12,000 by December across the four main Web 3.0 metaverses. Partly this growth has been because brands have been buying up space so they can create virtual stores and other experiences. In June 2021, one land package in Decentraland was sold for $913,000, with the developer Every Realm (formerly Republic Realm) turning it into an entire shopping district, Metajuku (inspired by Japan’s Harajuku shopping district).

## From DeFi to DAO

In time, the virtual real estate market could start seeing services much like
 in the physical world, including credit, mortgages and rental agreements. However, with the emergence of decentralized finance (DeFi), collateralized lending primitives and the composability of blockchain token-based digital assets, a next-generation financing company could potentially leverage digital clothing as collateral to underwrite virtual land and property mortgages. In fact, the financing company may not be a company at all, but instead, a self- organizing, mission-based community of people (who may not have met at all in person), also known as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). The DAO may have seeded its original balance sheet into a multi-signature wallet to create the mortgages. An additional layer of tokenomics to incentivize certain participant or community behaviors creates another level of gamification and commercialization.

## Work in the metaverse

Supply and demand dynamics are driving more people into the meta-economy. This, in turn, will necessitate the development of new skills and generate
 new opportunities to make money. After all, people will have to develop and build the products that are consumed in the virtual world—establishing huge opportunities for the creator economy. RTFKT is a virtual shoe designer that has recently been acquired by Nike.13 It has created an interesting bridge between digital and physical merchandise (NFT owners receive physical sneakers that match their NFTs), and is building an ecosystem of avatars, spaces and digital products, in addition to wearables. In a recent auction, RTFKT sneakers sold for up to $10,000 a pair. By contrast, some people will earn their livings providing services—the gig workers of the metaverse. For instance, if you are planning a virtual party and want musical entertainment, you could hire a singer or a DJ to perform. Virtual concerts have the potential to be more profitable than physical concerts, which deal with barriers such as capacity and parking. Recently, a major concert held in Fortnite was seen by 45 million people and grossed around $20 million, including sales of merchandise. People who otherwise would not have had access to such experiences, due to geography or cost, can now participate.

It will be interesting to see how marketing and advertising pans out, as it is potentially one of the biggest segments of the meta-economy. There are huge opportunities for branding and immersive
 ad experiences in virtual worlds due to the mass audiences available. As with the current generation of social media companies, advertising is the model that many platforms use to generate revenue. In-game ad spending is set to reach $18.41 billion by 2027.

## Expanded opportunities across industries and countries

It is not just business-to-consumer environments that will benefit. The metaverse will provide a massive opportunity for business-to-business enterprises. Take a manufacturer that is buying new parts for its equipment. Presently, the process involves receiving a physical brochure or an emailed PDF with static 2D pictures. In the metaverse, users could test the products in a virtual environment at lower cost. Imagine being able to build a complex digital twin of a factory or industrial space at massive scale, and test how robotics systems will interact with the physical environment.

One of the great possibilities of the metaverse is that it will massively expand access to the marketplace for consumers from emerging and frontier economies. The internet has already unlocked access to goods and services that were previously out of reach. Now, workers in low-income countries, for example, may be able to get jobs in western companies without having to emigrate. Educational opportunities will also expand, with VR worlds being a low-cost and effective way to access training. With these developments there will also have to be clear governance.

From a corporate perspective, there are opportunities to massively scale. Instead of having stores in every city, a major retailer might build a global hub in the metaverse that is able to serve millions of customers. Beyond retailers, the metaverse will turbocharge the shift in gaming, sports betting and gambling from cash to crypto. Companies such as Sightline Payments, that have built infrastructure to support cashless digital gaming for live sports and casinos, are ideally placed to capitalize on the opportunity as these industries rapidly transition to offering experiences to gamers in the metaverse.
